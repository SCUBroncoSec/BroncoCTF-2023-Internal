Yup, that’s me. You’re probably wondering how I got into this situation...

Now that I'm here, I'm realizing that I didn't check if this place is reputable or not. Can you do me a favor and check how many Yelp reviews this company has?

__Note: The flag is *not* in typical flag format. For your submission, you should enter `broncoctf{<int>}` where `<int>` in the number of Yelp reviews.__
