There are numerous clues in the description to let you know the developer is, in fact, a cow. Along with the given code being entirely variations of "Moo", you will likely look up variations of "Moo language" or "Cow programming language". Eventually this will lead you to [Esolang](https://esolangs.org/wiki/COW), and then to the [COW language homepage](https://bigzaphod.github.io/COW/). This will prove that you are on the right track, as example code will look very similar to the given text. 

The next step will then be to execute the code. The COW homepage has a link to an [online interpreter](https://frank-buss.de/cow.html) that can easily run the program. Running the program will print the flag.

In theory, it is also possible to use one of the other linked COW compilers/interpreters to execute to code. However, this has not been tested as it is much simpler to use the online interpreter.
