## Test Status: Deployed (hosted version doesn't work)

## Target Difficulty: Medium (200 pts)

## Description

A hundred people are at this hacking party, and we have a program to search for people there.  
I heard that a prankster wants to jumpscare five people at the party while they are busy coding. We think he may have left some evidence in the search program. Can you help us figure out who the prankster is targeting?

**Tip:** The flag is in the form broncoctf{Name1Name2Name3...} where a "Name" is a person at the party, case sensitive, joined together with no space.

**Mac and Linux users:** you will have to run `chmod +x` on the executable you downloaded in order for it to run
