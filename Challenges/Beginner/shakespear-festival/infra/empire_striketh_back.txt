Enter CHORUS. 


O, ’tis for the Rebellion a dark time. 

For though they have the Death Star all destroy’d, 
Imperi’l troops did from the ashes climb 
And push the rebels closer to the void. 

Across the galaxy pursu’d with speed, 

The rebels flee th’Imperi’l Starfleet vast. 

A group with Luke Skywalker in the lead 
Hath to the ice world known as Hoth flown fast. 
Meanwhile, the cruel Darth Vader is obsess’d 
With finding young Skywalker. Thus he hath 
Through ev’ry point of space begun his quest 
By sending robot probes to aid his wrath. 

In time so long ago begins our play. 

In war-torn galaxy far, far away.

SCENE 1. 

The ice world of Hoth 


LUKE 


Enter Luke Skywalker. 


If flurries be the food of quests, snow on. 

Belike upon this Hoth, this barren rock. 

My next adventure waits. ’Tis time shall tell. 

And yet, is it adventure that I seek? 

Shall danger, fear, and action fill my days? 

Shall all my life be spent in keen pursuit 
Of great adventure and her fickle fame? 

It seemeth I have had enough of life 
To fill a thousand normal human lives— 

A princess in a vision spake to me. 

My aunt and uncle by stormtroopers slain, 

A hasty flight from my home, Tatooine, 

A pilot and a Wookiee and a Knight, 

A rescue brave within our cruel foe’s grasp. 

My teacher kill’d, and then the final scene: 

The Death Star battle—many friends were lost. 
But in the end a greater war was won. 

Adventure hath both taken from my life. 

And given to me ev’rything I have. 

And thus I seek and shun its tempting ways. 

E’en now adventure knocks upon the door: 

A flaming orb hath struck the ground nearby. 

Is it a portent of some ill to come? 

[Into comlink:] ’Tis Echo-Three to 

Echo-Seven: Han, 

My true companion e’er, canst thou hear me? 




HAN 


LUKE 


HAN 


[through comlink:] Aye, truly, chuck, thy voice 
rings loud and clear. 

What can I do for thee, my noble friend? 

My circle ’round the area hath been 
Completed now, but naught of life nor forms 
Of life my scan hath yet uncover’d. 

[through comlink:] —Nay. 

There is not life enough upon this cube 






Of ice to fill an empty space cruiser. 
The sensors have I put in place, so shall 
I now return unto the base. 


LUKE —’Tis well, 

And I, forsooth, shall soon meet with thee there. 
But I have spied a met’orite that hath 
Its landing made near here. So shall I go 
And fix my eyes upon the scene. I’ll not 
Be long, I warrant; then, I shall return. 

Enter WAMPA, aside. 


WAMPA You viewers all, whose gentle hearts do fear 

The smallest womp rat creeping on the floor. 

May now perchance both quake and tremble here. 
When wampa rough in wildest rage doth roar. 
Pray know that I a wampa simple am. 

And take no pleasure in my angry mood. 

Though with great force this young one’s face I 
slam, 

I prithee know I strike but for my food. 

LUKE Alas, is this th’adventure I am due. 

To die upon a vicious monster’s whim? 

I am attacked by this awful beast! 

O fate most wretched—shall I be his feast? 

[Exit, pursued by a wampa. 



HAN 


SCENE 2. 

The rebel base on Hoth 

Enter Han Solo. 


A scoundrel may not rise above his place— 

This is a fact the galaxy doth teach. 

For e’en though I have join’d rebellion’s ranks 
These many weeks and months, and gain’d 
respect 

Within their noble band, my scoundrel past 
Doth make its harsh demands upon my life. 

The bounty hunters sent by Jabba make 
Pursuit to win the price upon my head. 

So must I go once more unto the depths 
Of my old life, find Jabba of the Hutt 
And pay his ransom, thus to free my soul. 

I would not leave my noble rebel friends, 

I would not leave the cause for which they fight, 
I would not leave the princess and her charm, 

I would not leave all these, and yet I must. 

A life’s not well lived under threat of death. 
Especially with men of cruel intent— 

Who for a price shall fill the Hutt’s demands— 
Upon the trail of my indebtedness. 

And so, my mate Chewbacca and I leave 
Upon the instant that the ship is set to go. 


Enter Chewbacca, working on the Millennium Falcon. 



I say, Chewbacca, ho! Aye, Chewie!

But practice patience; I shall help thee soon. 

Egh, auugh, egh. 

[Exit Chewbacca. Han crosses to 
command center with Princess Leia 
and General Rieekan. 

—Solo, wouldst thou speak with me? 

Good general, the sensors are in place. 

And surely shalt thou know if aught comes near 
Our hidden station here. 

—Well. Prithee say. 

Commander Sky walker, hath he yet made 
Report? 

—Nay, truly. He hath gone to see 
A met’orite that hath made landfall near. 

With all the met’orites a’falling in 
This system, I believe we shall have pains 
And trouble in detecting ’proaching ships. 

[aside:] How shall I tell my news most difficult. 
And crush this man’s great hopes for what’s 
ahead? 

Eear not, O heart, but be direct and calm: 

’Tis best approach’d straight on, like th’Kessel 
Run. 

[To Rieekan:] My general, I cannot stay. I must 



Make haste and get me hence, e’en now.

[aside:] —Alack, 

How like a death knell sounds this news to me! 

I tell thee truly when I say to thee: 

This news doth break this gen’ral’s gentle soul. 

I could not be more sorry, pilot brave. 

A price still lies upon my head, and if 
I do not make amends with Jabba, I 
Shall not repay with money, nay, but life. 

A price too dear, indeed! A death mark is 
No kind companion to a free man’s life. 

Thou art a warrior noble. Solo, and 
I hate to lose thee. 

—And thou art a kind. 

Good general, sirrah, I hate to go. 

[Exit Rieekan. Han turns to Princess 

Leia. 

And so. Your Highness great, this is the end. 

’Tis so. 

—I prithee mourn me not, and show 
No sentiment. Earewell, thou princess cold. 

[Aside:] I go, and hope she’ll follow hard upon, 

Eor if she shall not follow, all is lost. 

[Han Solo begins to exit, pursued by 

Princess Leicu

—What is thy pleasure, Highness? 

I did believe that thou had chos’n to stay. 

The bounty hunter we did meet on Ord 
Manted hath chang’d my mind. 

—We need thee, Han. 

What “we”? Why speakest thou of “we”? 

Dost thou in royal terms speak here of “we”? 
Hast thou a rodent in thy pocket, such 
That thou and he are “we”? What meanest thou? 
What need is there that thou dost share with all? 
Speak not of “we,” but “L” O princess, what 
Dost thou most need? Not “we,” not “they,” but 
thou? 

I know not what thou speakest of. 

—’Tis true. 

Most probably thou dost not know thyself. 

And what, pray tell, precisely should I know? 

Of what great myst’ry am I unaware? 

Hast thou the depths of Leia plumb’d and seen 
What lies within my soul, my very core? 

Be not elusive, nay! Thou wouldst that I 
Should stay because of how thou feelest in 
Thy heart about me. Need hath turn’d to want. 
Pray, tell me not thy needs, but thy desires. 

Thou art a leader full of skill, ’tis true. 

Thine answer leadeth thee astray. Let fly!

I see it in thine aspect now, let fly! 
Tell me the answer true. 

—Thy vanity 

Hath pufPd up thine imagination. 


—Aye? 

Then why dost thou yet follow me? Wert thou 
Afraid I would depart without a kiss? 

I would as eagerly kiss Wookiee lips. 

That can arranged be. By heaven’s breath, 

A kiss would suit thee well! 

[Exit Han Solo. 


—O man of bile! 

Thou wouldst make e’en the coolest temper burn, 
Eor thou art made of heat and flame and fire. 

No wood may stand within a mile of thee 
But it shall roast as if ’twere on the sun. 

And now, thy scorching manner lights my fuse. 
Aye truly, I confess I am aflame: 

Thine eyes create combustion in my heart. 

Thy face doth cause my cheeks to flood with 
warmth. 

Thy fingers set me trembling at their touch. 

Thy hands may hold the secrets of my soul. 

Thou hast a pow’r o’er Leia’s very self. 

Yet wear my patience past what I can bear. 

Eor O, how thou dost needle, jest, and prick 
When thou dost think thy pride is at the stake. 

Be not so full of bile, my noble Han. 

I prithee, choose the tender side of wit. 

If thou couldst ever put thy pride away. 

Belike my prejudice would fall aside. 



Then could our two hearts sing a melody, 

Instead of clashing in disharmony. 

[Exit Princess Leicu 




SCENE 3. 

The rebel base on Hoth. 

Enter C-3P0 and R2-D2, with Han Solo and Chewbacca aside at the 

Millennium Falcon. 

C-3PO 

0 R2, thou dost ever plague me so! 

E’en now have we been in dishonor sent 

Away from our good princess’ chamber. Fie! 

Such breach of etiquette and protocol, 

And all the fault doth on thy shoulders lie. 

R2-D2 

Beep, meep, beep, whistle, meep, beep, squeak, 
nee, meep! 

C-3PO 

Lay not thy blame upon my shoulders, droid— 

I did, at no point, ask thee to engage 

The thermal heater. ’Twas but a remark 

Upon the coldness of the princess’ room. 

R2-D2 

Beep, whistle, squeak. 

C-3PO 

—But freezing it should be! 

And now, how shall we dry off all her clothes? 

I truly know not how. 

R2-D2 

—Beep, meep, beep, hoo. 

C-3PO 

0, switch off!

Millennium Falcon.

Within my mind a keener tongue prevails. 

And though thou like a brother art to me. 

I’ll happily correct your errant ways. 

If thou didst think the thermal heater was 
Too hot, then shalt thou surely not endure 
The fire that I shall kindle with my wit. 

[C-3PO makes his way to Han Solo. 

[to Chewbacca:] Why hast thou taken this apart 
when 

I am striving to depart this wretched place? 
Excuse me. Sir. 

—Pray, mend the ship, and swift! 

Please, Sir, a word with thee. 

—What dost thou want? 

’Tis Princess Leia, Sir, she strives to reach 
Thee on th’communicator. 

—Then ’twas wise 
That I did turn it off, for I have no 
Desire to speak with her. 

—I see. But she 

Hath after Master Luke made inquiry. 

For surely he hath not return’d unto 
The base. She knows not where he is.

Deck officer, deck officer! 


Enter deck officer. 


—Yes, Sir? 

Dost thou know where Commander Skywalker Is? 

—I’ve not seen him, but ’tis possible 
He through the entrance to the south return’d. 

“ ’Tis possible”? I prithee, good lad, go 
Thou thither and find out. It grows quite dark 
Outside. 

—^Aye, Sir. 

[Exit deck officer. 


—Excuse me. Sir, but may 
I ask what doth transpire? 

—Thou mayst indeed. 

O man impossible! Come thou, R2, 

Let us return unto the princess now. 

The drying of her clothes is now the least 
Of all our worries, for another ill 



HAN 


OFFICER 


Far greater than our mishap is afoot. 

In confidence I tell thee: I do fear 

That Master Luke grave danger doth confront. 

[Exit C-3PO and R2-D2. 

What portents strange, what evil tidings this: 

My friend by no one seen, the droids afraid, 
Chewbacca prone to error with the ship. 

The young deck officer so tentative— 

These things foretell some ill that shall occur. 

But if misfortune toucheth anyone. 

Let it be me and not my partner, Luke. 

For he is like a brother unto me. 

As all who fight with me in battle are. 

Though I did save him in the Death Star clash, 

’Tis he hath sav’d me from the smuggler’s life 
By leading me on paths more true than I 
Had e’er foreseen. Now do I call him friend. 

And this rebellion is the cause we share. 

From all my friends here I would not depart 
If I were not by Jabba hunted down. 

Aye, I would give my bones—my life—for great 
Rebellion’s sake if e’er it were requir’d. 

But soft you now: the officer returns. 


Enter deck officer. 


Good Sir, Commander Skywalker hath not 
Come in the entrance to the south. He may 
Have but forgotten to check in. 


—Nay, nay. 

His nature is not thus. Now tell me, are 
The speeders ready?

—Nay, we have not yet 
Adapted them unto the cold of Hoth. 

So then upon a tauntaun’s back I’ll ride. 

Though with especial foulness they abuse 
My nose, they are the speediest we have. 

But Sir, the temp’rature doth drop too fast 
Eor any living being to survive. 

’Tis true, and my dear friend doth bear the brunt. 
He shall not die while I have life or breath, 

Eor neither snow nor ice nor gloom of Hoth 
Shall stay my rescue of my greatest friend. 

Thy tauntaun shall but freeze ere thou canst ride 
Unto our prim’ry marker, I predict. 

Then I shall dine with thee tonight in Hell! 

[Exeunt Han Solo, Chewbacca, and 

deck officer. 


Enter Luke Skywalker, hanging upside down from balcony. 


LUKE What warren, friends, is this? I am within 

Some icy shelter. Now I do recall— 

The creature large hath ta’en me by surprise. 
Then quickly did my body overpow’r 
By knocking me aside with painful blow. 

It kill’d my tauntaun with its vicious claw. 
Unmoved by the creature’s awful scream. 

It must have dragg’d us to this frozen lair. 
E’en now I hear it gnaw my tauntaun’s flesh. 
The stench of musty death is in my nose. 



Now I’m awake, hung up by my own feet, 

And sounds of tearing skin and crunching bone 
Do echo through the monster’s gloomy cave. 
The tauntaun, though, is only the first dish. 
And I am bound to be the second course. 
Indeed, I have a problem grave, and how 
Shall I make rescue for myself? But wait— 
What’s there—a’lying on the snow nearby? 

It is my lightsaber—how fortunate! 

’Tis still too far to grasp with my own reach: 
Thus call I on the Force to save my life. 

O concentrate, and call upon the things 
Thou learn’st from Obi-Wan when he still liv’d. 
Forsooth, I feel the Force begin to flow— 
Within, nearby, inside, surrounding me. 

O Force most strong—the lightsaber’s at hand! 
Now am I free to flee the fierce beast’s clutch. 
But, lo, the creature comes to me anon! 

It will attack me in its fiery rage 
Unless I am the first to strike. Lay on!

O horrid interim of waiting, time 
That doth like snail unwillingly creep by. 

Full many hours have pass’d without a word 
Of Master Luke or Captain Solo. Now 
The day grows late, and whisper’d words of fear 
Throughout the base are heard for these men’s 
fate. 

It seems that all lose heart, and think the worst. 
For how can e’en our bold Han Solo stand 
The harsh and unrelenting chill of Hoth? 

But now, no more, C-3PO; thou art 
Not made to worry and to fret. Be brave! 

Come now, R2, there’s no more we can do. 
Behold, my joints are freezing. 

—Whistle, hoo. 

Say not such things! Of course we shall set eyes 
On Master Luke again. And he shall be 
In perfect health, thou impish little droid. 

Aye, he shall be in perfect health. 

[aside:] —I fear

Assault. ’Tis cold unto the core. ’Tis cold, 

I fear, unto the death. Bear up, droid soul.

My Mistress Leia, R2 makes report 
He hath not any signals yet receiv’d. 

However, he admitteth that his range 
Is far too weak to give up ev’ry hope. 

Your Highness, I do fear there’s nothing more 
That we may do tonight. The shield doors must 
Be closed.

That breaketh even now.

Meep, beep, meep squeak.

tongue! 

“A helpful strength” I pledg’d that I would be. 

But now have made these matters worse, for I 
Have giv’n our princess reason to be scar’d. 

Yet I do worry for my master’s life. 

And though I would not cause undue distress 
I fear that he may never make return. 

[To C-3PO:] Beep, squeak. 

—Nay, fear thou not, my silver friend. 

I’ll warrant he shall surely be all right. 

For Master Luke is clever, young, and spry 
E’en for a human being. So say I!

Enter C-3P0, R2-D2, Princess Leia, and Chewbacca. 


LUKE O what a torment have I just endur’d! 

For after my attack by creature cruel, 

I quickly made my exit from his lair 
And made my great escape amidst the snow. 

Far, far I ran to find a refuge safe. 

Yet too far from the rebels’ base I’ve gone. 

And now my strength has left—I fail again—

There thou shalt learn the Force from Yoda, aye

LUKE Ben, leave me not! Alas, I fall again.

dismounts his tauntaun. 

HAN Amid the burning snow and winter’s bite. 

Have I this journey ta’en to find my friend. 

But lo, what is this sight that now I see? 

’Tis Luke, collaps’d! O lad, be thou not dead! 

Give me some sign thou livest! Aye, Luke, live! 
The cold of Hoth shall yet be warmth to me 
If thou art still alive. Come now, good friend! 

[The tauntaun falls over, frozen to 

death 

LUKE {muttering:] O Ben, O Dagobah! 

[Han takes Luke’s lightsaber and 
cuts open the tauntaun, pulling 
Luke close to its warmth 




HAN —We’ve not much time. 

Stay with me, Luke. ’Tis true, this shall smell bad. 
But also shall it keep thee warm until 
The shelter hath erected been. O, vile! 

These tauntauns have an awful stench outside. 

But nothing did I know of wretchedness. 
Disgusting rot, and sick’ning filth till this 
New smell hath made attack upon my nose. 

[Han sits with Luke as night passes. 

The shelter now is fashion’d by my hands 
Both strong and deft. We shall await the morn 
With only tauntaun’s guts as company. 

O guardian of nighttime travelers. 

Be with me and my comrade Luke this eve. 

For we are merely pilgrims far from home 
Who wish to come again unto our mates. 

Now sev’ral anxious hours we’ve huddl’d here. 
And with the morning dawns the light of hope. 

My rebel friends shall surely make attempt 
To find where Luke and I have spent the night. 







Search well, my lads, the prize waits to be found!

Mayhap the cherish’d find shall yet be mine. 

Pray listen. Echo Base, to my report: 

There’s something here my scanner hath just 
found. 

’Tis yet unsure, but may a life form be. 
Commander Skywalker, dost thou hear me? 

’Tis Rogue Two. O good captain Solo, dost 
Thou hear? ’Tis Rogue Two.

R2 expresseth his relief as well! 


Enter Han Solo and Chewbacca. 


How goes it with thee, chuck? O verily. 

Thou dost look well to me. In faith, thou seem’st

Now thou dost owe me two good turns, my

[To Leicu] Indeed, Your Worship, well have you 
conspir’d 

To keep me in thy presence longer. 


—Eie! 

’Twas not my doing. Gen’ral Rieekan doth 
Believe that it is still too dangerous 
Eor any ship to leave the system, aye— 

E’en thy belov’d Millenn’um Falcon —till 
The shield of energy is active. 

—Ha! 

A cloth of fiction thou dost weave, yet I 
Have found the fatal error in thy stitch: 

Eor I believe thou wouldst not let a man 
So beautiful as I depart from thee. 

The only stitch I know is in my side, 

Erom laughing at thy pride most heartily. 

Thou mayst attempt to needle at my heart. 

But I am sewn of stronger thread than this. 

To say I would not let thee go—pish, pish! 

I know not whence thy great delusions come. 
Thou laser brain. 

[laughing:] —Gihut, gihut, gihut! 

Aye, laugh indeed, thou fuzzball large. But thou 
Hast not seen us alone i’ th’passage south.

What scruffy? Scruffy, how? Whose scruffiness? 

How am I all bescrufPd? [To Luke:] Belike my

Since now she hath her temper lost. True, Luke? 

Thus is it plain that till thou tam’st thy tongue. 

No tongue of woman shalt thou comprehend.

O kiss most rare, O lips from heaven sent! 

This is a moment I’ll not soon forget. 

Though I can sense her heart doth turn to Han, 
Still doth this kiss play tricks upon my soul. 

By this fair princess I have been bewitch’d— 



’Twas ever so since I saw her distress 
In R2’s beam, a’pleading for our help. 

But though the lass doth move my heart to joy 
I ne’er would tempt her with a word too large, 

For shall a Jedi’s path lead t’ward romance? 

But this sweet kiss I’ll hold in mem’ry’s vault 
As a reminder of my noble cause: 

To serve rebellion and my princess kind.

Good Sir, six million forms of language do 
I know, and I may tell thee true that this 
Strange signal is not by th’Alliance us’d. 

It may, perhaps, be an Imperi’l code. 

’Tis not a friendly sound, that much is sure. 

Now Chewie, come with me and we’ll to it. 
[Aside:] Snow creatures first, and now Imperi’l 
droids. 

What portents of great evil may these be? 

Though I am brave, forsooth these signs do make 
E’en my courageous heart begin to fear. 

I find myself afraid of what may come. 

That my whole soul shall freeze ere this is done. 
[To alh] Chewbacca and myself have ventur’d out 
To see the probe. Now Chewie gives a shout— 

It fires on him, and I respond in turn. 

Be gone, thou enemy of all that’s right. 

But wait, now what hath happen’d? I releas’d 
A blast most simple—aye, a single blast. 

Yet it appears that single blast was all 
It could withstand; the blast was lethal, friends. 
Now naught is left, for it hath been destroy’d. 

What was’t? 

—A droid. My blast did not strike hard. 

Belike the thing did self-destruct. 

—’Tis clear! 

A probe droid from the Empire. This doth mean 
The start of our rebellion’s flight from Hoth, 

Eor now that we discovered have been 
We lack security. 

—Agreed. Methinks 



The Empire knoweth we are here on Hoth. 

[Aside:] My sense of doom and dread is not 
without 

Its cause, for this event is grave indeed. 

RIEEKAN Good friends, dear rebels, comrades one and all. 

We have no choice but to flee hastily. 

Our swift evacuation shall commence. 

And till ’tis done, make ready our defense.

Enter Admiral Ozzel, General Veers, and Captain Piett.

OZZEL —Yes, Captain. 

PIETT —Here’s a thing 

That thou shouldst see, good Sir. We have 
receiv’d 

Report from a Hoth system probe, the best 
That we have found so far. 

OZZEL —Your best, belike. 

Shall bested be, for thousands of these probes 

We have a’wandering the galaxy 

And looking for the rebels. I want proof, 

Piett, not leads. Proof—only that—is best. 

PIETT But Sir, this best is better yet, for it 

Hath found some forms of life upon the ground. 

OZZEL How better yet? How best? It could be but 

An error or some useless reading. If 
We were to follow ev’ry lead, our best 
Would soon turn worst. 

—^And yet I do maintain 
My best is better yet for this: ’tis said 
That Hoth is all devoid of human forms.

It seems, good Sir, the rebels have been found. 
Why else would sign of life appear on Hoth? 
I’ll warrant. Sir, my forecast shall prevail. 


Enter Darth Vader. 


You have found something good? 

—My Lord, we have. 

A probe that late hath made descent on Hoth 
Hath made discovery of both life forms 
And the appearance of a power source. 

[Piett shows Vader the screen. 

Thy judgment hath prov’d best, Piett: ’tis them. 
Eorsooth, the rebels may be found therein. 

My Lord, there are throughout the galaxy 
So many settlements we have not mapp’d. 

This could be smugglers, maybe even— 


—Nay, 

That is the system, certain am I oft. 

And Skywalker is with them there. Now set 
Thy course t’ward Hoth, and Gen’ral Veers, 
prepare 

Your men for combat.

Veers, and Captain Piett. 

—Hath not a Sith eyes?

VEERS 


Assault with lightsaber, do we not die? 

I have a body as do other men, 

Though made, in part, of wires and steel. And 
aye, 

I vari’us passions feel, as all men do. 

So I, a Sith, shall not distracted be 
Till I attain the thing for which I seek. 

Therefore I shall pursue this Skywalker 
Unto the limit of the galaxy. 

Eor true, he hath the Death Star quite destroy’d. 
And true, he hath the Eorce with him as well. 
But truly, more than that the boy doth have— 
Eor truth be told, his name doth stir my soul. 
The boy’s connection to myself I do 
Not understand as yet. This Skywalker 
Must have some link to my life past, but what? 
So shall this Sith pursue this rebel lad. 

And find the missing truth of Vader’s life. 


Enter General Veers. 


What news dost thou have, Gen’ral Veers? 
—My Lord, 

Our noble fleet hath flown to Hoth in haste 
With hopes to catch the rebels by surprise. 
The fleet has moved out of lightspeed now. 
But com-scan hath detected a sharp shield 
Of energy surrounding planet six 
Within the system. It is strong enough 
To hinder what bombardment we can make. 
This grim news I report with sadden’d mien: 
It seems, my Lord, our fleet is all too close. 



VADER 

The rebels are aware of our attack, 

Eor Adm’ral Ozzel left lightspeed too near 

To the Hoth system. 

VEERS 

—He believ’d surprise 

Was wiser... 

VADER 

—Say no more. Speak not to his 

Defense. He is as clumsy as he is 

Replete with ignorance. Prepare your troops 

Now, Veers, to lead a ground attack. We shall 

Still win the day, despite the blunder. 

VEERS 

—Aye. 

[Exit General Veers. 

Vader hails Admiral Ozzel and Captain Piett, who enter by balcony.

Lord Vader, I am happy to report 

The fleet has come out of lightspeed and is 
Prepar’d to—

Admiral Ozzel using the Force.

But nevermore shalt thou have chance to fail.

That thou, in thy last breath, shalt know my 
pow’r. 

Captain Piett? 

PIETT 

—My Lord? 

VADER 

—Prepare to land 



PIETT 


Our troops beyond the shield of energy, 

And then deploy our fleet so naught can ’scape 
The system. Do it, Admiral Piett. 

And be thou sure to rise to thy new rank.

Vader. 

Alas, with this promotion comes some dread. 

For Vader hath no rev’rence for the head.

The rebel base on Hoth

with a MAINTENANCE DROID.

CHEWBAC.

A pilot must respect his ship with care, 

And play physician to her ev’ry need. 

With patience and with tender healing touch 
I caringly embrace each bolt and wire. 

Now, ’tis repair’d. [To Chewbacca:] Good Chewie, 
try it now! 

Egh. 

[The ship begins to smoke and 

spark. 

—Nay! Act thou with speed, and turn it off! 
[Aside:] Physician, heal thyself from too much 
haste. 


Enter Luke Skywalker. 


LUKE [aside:] The last time I said my farewell to these 

Compatriots of mine, ’twas ere the Death 
Star battle when it seem’d as though they were 
Deserting us. But now, their valor prov’d. 

Their hearts align’d with good Rebellion’s cause. 
I’ll wish them on their merry way with joy.

[To Chewbacca:] Chewbacca, brave, ’tis now my 
time to leave, 

Eor soon to Dagobah my path is bound. 

[embracing Luke:] Egh! 

—How your tight embrace doth warm my 
heart— 

But also strains my bones, thou jolly brute. 

Well met, young lad. [To droid:] There must a 
reason be 

Why this malfunction hath occur’d. But now, 

I prithee, get thee hence. 

[Exit maintenance droid. 

Art thou yet well? 

Aye, verily. [Aside:] O what words would I say 
To this man here, if words were loud enough! 

But hath a word e’er been created, which 
Could tell the comrade’s love I feel for him. 
Articulate the good I sense in him. 

Express the debt of life I owe to him? 

At times ’tis true that words betray us all— 

The mighty pow’r of language fails to speak. 

And neither tongue nor rhetoric gives aid. 

This Han hath found a life among our band 
That did transform his former, solo self. 

But now he takes his leave to pay the price 
Of former indiscretions come to call. 

I would explain how much he means to me, 

I would disclose my deep respect for him, 

I would unveil my brotherlike regard, 

I would reveal the workings of my soul— 

But at this moment words are render’d weak. 



Thus, he must see the story in my eyes, 

Peruse the tale that’s told within my heart. 

And there read more than ever can be penn’d. 

HAN Now be thou careful, friend. 

LUKE —And thou as well. 

[Exit Luke SkywaUcer. 

HAN A noble lad, and true. If Fate is kind, 

I shall make right the danger I am in 
And live to fight aside him once again.

Enter the Controller and General rieekan.

Has just emerg’d from hyperspace, and now 
Has been detected in yon sector four. 

RIEEKAN Divert all pow’r unto our forward shield. 

In doing so we may protect the base 
Until the transports their escape have made. 
Then, let us all prepare for ground assault.

Both for the swift retreat of transports hence, 

And to defend our base until they’re fled. 

The carriers shall meet up at the north, 

And larger transports leave once they are full. 

Two fighter escorts shall be sent with each 
And shall remain quite close, for our strong shield 
Will be disarm’d a fleeting length of time. 

’Twill be a passage dangerous no doubt. 

But with the Eorce we shall prevail, indeed. 

I prithee, say again: shall only two 

Of our small fighters match a Star Destroy’r? 

Pray, screw your courage to the sticking place. 
Our ion cannons shall with lethal fire 
Make ev’ry pathway clear. When you have clear’d 
The shield of energy, then go anon 
Unto our rendezvous. Do all agree? 

Will ye all go in great rebellion’s name? 

Aye, Princess, aye! 

—We shall heed thy command. 

Now ev’ry one unto their stations, go! 

[Exeunt rebel pilots, including 
Hobbie and Lieutenant Derlin. 

[to Controller:] Belike the power generators will 
Their prim’ry target be. Prepare thou now 
To open up the shield. And may the Eorce 
Attend our swift retreat, our hearts inspire! 

Now standby ion cannon; aye, and fire.

SCENE 2. 

The ice world of Hoth 
Enter chorus. 


CHORUS The transports make their way deep into space; 

The ion cannon leads as they take flight. 

But now the rebels grave new dangers face, 

As th’Empire sends a ground assault to fight. 


Enter Luke Skywalker and Dack, his copilot, with Rebel Pilots, 
including Wedge Antilles, Janson, and Zev. 


DACK How dost thou fare, good Sir? For I have heard 

Of your unlucky recent incident. 

How is it with thee after the attack? 

LUKE Quite well, I thank thee, Dack. And art thou well? 

DACK Aye, truthfully. Commander—I do feel 

I could the Empire overthrow myself. 

If I were giv’n the opportunity. 

A single warrior to bring them down, 

A single hand to show rebellion’s strength, 

A single mind that could outwit them all, 

A single Dack to best the Empire’s might. 

LUKE O noble soul, how like a soldier said! 

It seems that thou and I are fashion’d from 
One cloth—one fabric knits our souls together. 



The feeling you express is one I’ve known. 
Indeed, it is a potent privilege, 

But also brings responsibility. 

Enter AT-ATS 1, 2, and 3, giant Imperial walkers, on other side. 


AT-AT 1 But who did bid thee join with us? 

AT-AT 3 —Piett. 

’Twas he who order’d me to come with ye 
To crush the rebels and their little base. 

AT-AT 2 Well said, for I know of no baser base— 

’Twill be a vict’ry great when ’tis destroy’d. 
But think ye we shall in this fight prevail? 

The rebels are a force formidable. 

AT-AT 1 My friends, we have had quite enough of talk: 

The battle is upon us, let us go. 

And ye who doubt, I pray remember this: 
Although we are but AT-ATs gray and plain. 
We have a noble task to undertake— 

Our mighty Emperor’s reign to protect. 

The great Darth Vader to obey and aid. 

And Admiral Piett to serve with pride. 

So shall an AT-AT swoon before the fight. 

Or should our legs be shaken ere th’assault? 
Have we been made to cower? I say nay! 

An AT-AT should be made of sterner stuff. 

AT-AT 3 [to AT-AT 2:] I pray, good walker, is he ever 

thus? 


AT-AT 2 


Aye, truly. Sir, I never yet have met 



An All Terrain Armored Transport who 
Is loftier of mind than this one here. 

Indeed, although like us he’s made of steel, 

He never enters battle zones unless 
He hath made some great speech to steel his 
nerves. 

It does no harm. 

AT-AT 3 —No harm, but to mine ears. 

I’d rather fight than hear another speech. 

AT-AT 1 Now let us go, these rebels to destroy! 

[The AT-ATs advance on Luke 
Skywalker and other rebel pilots. 



LUKE [to rebel pilots:] Now stay together, men. 

DACK —^Alas, good Luke, 

The ship’s computer hath malfunction’d. O, 
I am not set for this attack! 

LUKE —Be patient. 

We shall use pattern delta now, anon!

The strength of their robust exteriors. 

Rogue group, use thy harpoons and cables, too. 
Let us go for their legs and trip them up— 
Perhaps they may be bested from beneath. 

Dack, art thou with me?

Put fire into the system. I’ll attempt 
To quickly gain some pow’r another way. 

I prithee, be thou careful now, young Dack! 

[The fight resumes. Dack is struck. 

Alas, I die! Pare well. Commander Luke! 

[Dack dies. 


Nay, Dack! O agony of battle, curse 
Of war, and dread of ev’ry soldier’s heart: 

To suffer at the hands of enemies. 

To end one’s days by pow’r of the unjust! 

What use is war? Por it doth ravage all 
Within its path, and what hath it e’er solv’d? 

’Tis rare that peace doth follow in war’s wake. 
Indeed, this recent blow doth only urge 
And heighten my destructive sentiments: 

I shall avenge thee, Dack, and slay these here 
Who have thy lifeblood ta’en, and seal’d thy fate.

I do. Rogue Leader. 

—Wedge, I need thee now. 

I’ve lost my gunner: thou must strike their legs 
With thy harpoon. I’ll give thee aid—we’ll fly 
Together, follow close behind me. 


—Aye! 

Now activate harpoon and slay these beasts! 

[The fight resumes. Wedge and his 
gunner, Janson, strike AT-AT 1 with 
a rope around the legs. 

What treachery! The rebels have assail’d 
My weakest part. My legs, good comrades—they 
Have struck where I most vulnerable am. 

Well hit, brave Janson. Now encircle him 
And bring this giant down to meet his end. 

It worketh, friends! His legs hath been confin’d. 
And thus the brute hath trouble with his stride. 
Just one more pass around, and then detach! 

The cable is detach’d! He falls!

But we shall yet o’erwhelm them utterly. 

I’ll make approach unto their hidden base. 

Identify their systems in my sights. 

And then shall on the generator fire. 

Rogue Two, art thou beside me in this fight? 

We need the help of ev’ry fighter here. 

Not long ago thou rescu’d Han and me 
Erom our meek shelter on the ice of Hoth: 

Thou art a man of cunning, strength, and wit. 

And thus I ask thee on thy honor. Sir: 

Art thou prepar’d to face this harsh assault? 

Aye, verily. Rogue Leader, that I am. 

My life I am prepar’d to sacrifice 
To save rebellion from this fierce attack. 

Then let us all approach the knaves again. 

Prepare your swift harpoon and we shall strike! 

They think themselves the noble ones, but we 
Defend the Emp’ror’s righteousness today. 

Well spoken. Let us fight for Empire’s might!

Alas, poor Zev. Too many lost—such good 
And worthy men have met their end to these 
Confounded walkers. Fie! This battle bleak 
May mean Rebellion’s end. ’Tis now my turn— 

My ship hath ta’en a hit. I fall, yet am 
Not slain. Indeed, though here I lie upon 
The ground, I spy an opportunity. 

For while this awful monster walks above, 

I spy his weakness as I lie below. 

He passes just beyond me—now to it! 

Revenge should have no bounds when friends are 
slain. 

And now their memory doth push me on. 

My lightsaber shall strike the lethal blow; 

I’ll hit where he shall feel it, in his heart— 

If ever such cruel beast did have a heart. 

[Luke strikes AT-AT 3 from below, 
and AT-AT 3 dies. 

I perish, comrade true, but fall with pride! 

Although my fellow AT-ATs meet their ends, 

I press toward my goal with purpose firm. 

The rebels’ power generator is 
Within the target of my lasers keen. 

Now all the fallen AT-ATs I salute 
As for my noble Emperor I shoot!

generator. Exeunt all, in confusion.

We have no choice. 

—Indeed, thou speakest true.

Farewell, farewell! Parting is such sweet sorrow 
That I shall say farewell till thou hast left.

Alas, it seems that romance is not one 
Of 3PO’s six million forms of speech. 

[Exit R2-D2. C-3PO moves to

Loud sounds of shaking are heard. 

O zounds! What is this pow’rful shaking here? 

The base begins to crumble even now. 

Our humble shelter made of snow and ice 
Is now defeated by the Empire’s might 
And starts to fall apart. O, shall we too? 

Shall our rebellion suffer this same Fate— 

To be destroyed by the Empire cruel?

From Jabba’s bounty hunters, I cannot:

—Prithee, wait for me! 

[As they make their way to the ship, 
a wall falls in their path. 

The battle is within the very walls. 

And ev’ry portent tells of dread and doom. 

[Into comlink:] Good transport, this is Solo. Take 
your leave— 

Our way has now become a wayward thing. 

All fill’d with mounds of ice that block our path. 
This moment calls for quick decision. Thus, 

I shall with Leia flee on Falcon’s wings. 

[Han Solo and Princess Leia run the 
other way, toward the Millennium 
Falcon, shutting the door against C- 

3PO. 

But wait, where do you go? Pray, do come back! 
Most typical this is. O wretched fate. 

To be deserted by my friends most dear. 

These human beings care but little for 
Us droids who ever serve with loyalty. 

Thus shall I end my days within this base, 

A frozen remnant of the rebels’ stay 
On Hoth. Belike one day explorers shall 
Discover this defeated base, shall dig 
Into its core and find a golden droid 
Whose final resting place was ice and snow.

“Who would abandon such a lovely droid?” 

No doubt this shall be their response when they 
Espy me here. “What wretched humans would 
Leave such a one as this alone to rot?” 

I shudder at this thought, let it not be! 

O open up your hearts unto my kind, 

Then open wide this door for kindness’ sake! 

[The door opens. 

Anon, thou goldenrod, thou heap of scrap. 

Else shalt thou ever stay within this base 
And make thyself a lasting icy grave. 

[aside:] This man is both the reason for my pain 
And for my joy. My gratitude o’erflows! 

[They enter the Millennium 

Ealcon. 

[to Chewbacccu] Now wherefore doth the ship not 
function right? 

Pray, would it help if I did disembark 
And push with all a princess’ might upon’t? 

Belike! 

—Pray, Captain Solo, Captain Solo! 

Tut! 

—It shall wait. 

—This bucket full of bolts 
Shall ne’er beyond that blockade make escape. 

We may as well depart the base aboard 
A tauntaun’s furry back!

—The ship hath yet 

Surprising, keen maneuvers, sweetheart. Watch! 
The ship protects us with its lasers true 
Against thTmperi’l troops who come at us. 

See, Princess, see? Now Chewie, let us fly. 

And hope we shall not burn the engine out. 
Repairs are made—let us repair to space! 

One day thou shalt be wrong, and well I hope 
I shall bear witness to thy failure great. 

Anon, Chewbacca, lead us to our fate! 

[Exeunt in the Millennium Falcon.

Enter Luke Skywalker and R2-D2. 


The recent battle is both lost and won: 

’Tis lost because of rebels who expir’d, 

’Tis lost because our base is compromis’d, 
’Tis lost because our time on Hoth is done, 
’Tis lost because we now evacuate. 

And yet, ’tis won because two walkers fell, 
’Tis won because the foes arriv’d too late, 
’Tis won because our transport is away, 

’Tis won because we live to fight again. 

R2, we leave anon. With all due speed 
Prepare the ship for takeoff. 

—Meep, beep, squeak! 

Eear not, R2, for now we fly! 

—Beep, hoo. 

Now flies my weary soul to Dagobah, 

The place that hath in vision called to me. 

I know not what or who this Yoda is. 

Yet do I trust the ghost of my dear Ben. 

To be a Jedi is my calling now. 

To learn the ways of the most potent Eorce. 
Already have I had more mentors than 
Most people would e’er know in seven lives.

But here I am, drawn t’ward another quest— 

To travel to an unknown system, aye. 

And meet an unknown person who, perhaps. 

Doth not expect my sudden visit there. 

Yet I believe the words that came from Ben 
Were better than a foolproof prophet’s tale. 

There is a tide in the affairs of Jedi, 

Which taken at the flood, leads to the Eorce. 
Omitted, all the voyage of their life 
Is bound in black holes and in miseries. 

On such a full sea I am now afloat. 

And I must take the current where it serves. 

Or lose my chance to find my destiny. 

[aside:] O noble speech, with feeling brute and 
raw. 

My master’s honor shall I serve with pride. 

How best to show him I stand by his side? 

I’ll offer ways to help him navigate. 

[To Luke:] Beep, meep, meep, squeak, beep, 
whistle, whistle, beep? 

Nay, nothing’s wrong, I merely change our 
course. 

Meep, beep, squeak, whistle, beep, meep, meep, 
beep, whee? 

We shall not rendezvous with our friends yet. 
Unto the system Dagobah we travel— 

And what we shall meet there, time shall unravel.

SCENE 5.

Enter Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Princess Leia. 


HAN Hoth is a memory, but trouble still 

Doth follow close behind. With threat’ning force 
The Empire’s ships aggressively pursue 
My well-beloved ship. Shall we escape? 

CHEWBAC. Auugh! 

HAN —Truly, Chewie, I did see them too! 

LEIA I prithee, say—what hast thou seen, O Han? 

HAN Two Star Destroyers coming t’ward the ship. 

Enter C-3PO. 


C-3PO Sir, Sir, may I but say a thing to thee? 

HAN Pray, shut him up or shut him down, anon! 

Prepare our shield—they still may be outrun. 
[Aside:] With all my pilot’s wisdom, skill, and 
might 

I shall attempt to outwit these who chase. 

Now watch, you Empire vile, how I do fly! 
Eirst up and down, aye, up and down, this Han 
Will lead them up and down. Away we go!

Now back and forth, then back around again. 

They are confounded by my errant moves. 

Ha, ha! They are confus’d and fall behind. 

Thus we have slipp’d away, soon safe from harm. 
[To Chewbacccu] Make ready for the jump to 
hyperspace. 

But Sir! 

—They do approach! 

—Not yet: observe! 

[The Millennium Ealcon makes a 

sound and fails. 

Observe? What’s to observe, pray tell me plain? 

A fig! The ship seems to malfunction. Eie! 

’Tis possible we may in trouble be. 

I tried to warn thee. Sir, the hyperdrive 
Hath damag’d been, and cannot do its task! 
Lightspeed is verily unfeasible! 

Correction: we in trouble truly are. 

O that all I had fix’d were truly fix’d! 

But now I must in haste—and under threat 
Of death—attempt to fix the ship once more. 

[He runs to repair the ship, yelling 
back to Chewbacccu 

Where are the horizontal boosters hid? 

Egh, auugh!

quickly now. 

[Aside:] I know not how we shall escape this time. 
Of all the situations I have seen, 

Of all the problems small or dangers great, 

Of all the rubs and scrapes have scratch’d my life. 
Of all the enemies just barely fled— 

This moment now doth seem the worst of all. 

[Loud sound. Han is knocked aside. 

Alack, now what is this? What shakes the ship? 
How have we gone from bad to still worse yet? 

Good Han, return at once! 

[Han runs back to the cockpit 

’Tis asteroids! 

[aside:] O wicked thought and wonderful idea 
That cometh to me in this frightful time. 

I shall here chart a course none would expect: 

Not flee from danger, nay, but welcome it. 

And in so doing break the Empire’s grip 
While rescuing my princess from all harm. 

[To Chewbacccu] Set course two-seven-one. 

—What didst thou say? 

Thou wilt not enter in the ast’roid field? 

Eor certain thou art wild—but not insane! 

Yet they would be the madder to give chase. 

Thou must not do this to impress me, Han.

Yet would I rather live to tell him so!

Good Sir, attend: the possibility 
Of navigating fields of ast’roids is 
Three thousand seven hundred twenty to 
But one—the odds are well against thee here! 

The odds of rescuing a princess: low. 

The odds of smuggler turning rebel: lower. 
The odds of ending th’Death Star: lowest yet! 

I tell thee, droid: assail me not with odds! 

[aside:] Behold, what keen maneuvers doth he 
make. 

And how, like Gungans sinking in the swamp. 
Our enemies do fall behind us, slain. 

What bravery he showeth for my sake. 

If you recall. Your Highness, you did hope 
You would bear witness to my failure great: 

It may be now. 

—My word I do rescind. 

We shall be pulveriz’d if we remain 
A’floating in this field of wayward rocks. 

Thou hast thy honor proven, Han, now please: 
Let us seek safety in another place. 

I cannot argue with thine argument. 

I shall attempt to fly us closer in 
Toward a larger ast’roid. 

—Gloser? 

—^Auugh!

Excuse me. Princess, but where are we bound? 

[The Millennium Talcon flies deep 
into one of the asteroids. 

My hope flies unto you, most worthy man. 

My hope for us, and for our safety, too. 

I hope it is the Eorce that leadeth thee, 

I hope that thou dost know what thou dost do. 

Thy hopes do echo mine, my lady, true. 

[Exeunt into an asteroid’s tunnel 



SCENE 6. 

Aboard the Empire’s Super Star Destroyer. 


Enter Admiral Piett with Darth Vader, replacing his mask. 


PIETT [aside:] O sight most tragic, this—a robot-man 

Who doth require a mask to stay alive. 

What situation e’er did lead to this? 

How can he stand to live beneath a mask? 

But soft, Piett, and reconsider this: 

Aye, verily, how shall I judge? The mask 
He wears is far more obvious than most. 

With Vader it is plain he wears a mask. 

Though few have seen the scarring underneath. 
But truly, what man doth not wear a mask? 

For all of us are masked in some way— 

Some choose sharp cruelty as their outward face. 




Some put themselves behind a king’s fagade, 
Some hide behind the mask of bravery, 

Some put on the disguise of arrogance. 

But underneath our masks, are we not one? 
Do not all wish for love, and joy, and peace? 
And whether rebel or Imperial, 

Do not our hearts all beat in time to make 
The pounding rhythm of the galaxy? 

So while Darth Vader’s mask keeps him alive. 
And sits upon his face for all to see, 

’Tis possible he is more honest than 
A man who wears no mask, but hides his self.

Yes, Admiral? 

—Our ships have found the swift 
Millenn’um Falcon, Lord. However, it 
Hath ventur’d deep into an ast’roid field. 

It seems unsafe to make pursuit therein: 

To follow it is far too great a risk. 

Thy fear of asteroids concerns me not. 

I want the ship, not thy most weak dismay. 

I understand, my Lord, and shall obey. 

[Exeunt 



SCENE 7. 

The Dagobah system. 


LUKE 


Enter Luke Skywalker and R2-D2. 


What misadventure I have seen today! 

Our sensors spied no cities or machines 
Within this system desolate, but life 
Forms plenty. As we made our way unto 
The planet’s atmosphere, all went awry: 

My X-wing ship began to shake and groan. 

My scopes had fail’d, and I did blindly spin 
Into a landing doom’d to end with strife. 

’Tis almost fortunate that I did land 
Within this swampy bog where now the ship 
Is partway sunk, for had I hit the ground 
My ship and droid and even my own self 
Might have been crush’d, and ev’rything 
destroy’d. 

But now my ship is fixed in the mire. 

And how it shall come out I cannot tell. 

Was this first trouble all I would endure? 

Nay, nay! It seemeth Fate did not see fit 
To send pain singular, but multiple! 

Fate hath provided pains abundantly. 

For this is not the end of our distress. 

As R2 and I headed for the shore 
He fell into the water, wheels to scope. 

And was assaulted by a mighty beast— 

Aye, swallow’d whole and disappear’d from sight. 
For seeming ages I did search for him. 



R2-D2 


LUKE 


To no avail. And then, with frightful scream, 

He was ejected from the swamp as fast 
As proton-filTd torpedoes from their shaft. 
Above my head he sail’d, well o’er the ground. 
And landed in a heap of dirt and grime. 

’Twas only for his metal-tasting shell 
This little droid shall live to see tomorrow. 

So much misfortune! After all this pain 
I should feel grateful still to have my life. 

But now we are maroon’d within a place 
Where neither friend nor contact may be found. 
I should have listen’d to the wise R2 
When he said coming here would work us woe. 
Our camp is now set up, our food prepar’d. 

My faithful R2 chargeth up his pow’r. 

The semblance of good order we present— 

But I have neither stomach nor desire 
To sit down to a hale and hearty feast. 

More pressing, too, I must this Yoda find. 
Indeed, if that good man doth e’en exist. 

Look ’round about, R2: is this place not 
Unlikely for a Jedi master’s home? 

’Tis strange, ’tis passing strange, ’tis pitiful. 

Beep, squeak? 

Enter Yoda, hidden behind. 


—I know not what it is, dear friend. 

’Tis like some thing appearing from a dream. 
Some midnight reverie I cannot shake. 

For neither does this circumstance seem real. 
Nor do I slumber here—aye, that I know. 

It seems the place is but a walking shadow—

Beep, whistle, meep? 

—I know not. I do feel— 

[Yoda reveals himself. 


What dost thou feel, hmm? 

Prithee, I would truly know 
What is it thou feel’st? 

[Luke points his blaster at Yoda. 

That odd, familiar sense that we are watch’d! 

Beep, beep, meep, whistle, beep, squeak, whistle, 
nee! 

Away with weapons! 

I mean no harm, but wonder 
Why thou hast come here. 

Thou sneaking imp! I look for someone here. 

Looking, are you, hmm? 

Eound someone you have, it seems! 

Is that not correct? 

’Tis true, I may suppose—I’ve someone found. 
Though such a one as this did not expect. 

Help you I can, aye. 

[Aside:] I, indeed, more help shall be 
Than he imagines.

O, great warrior! 

A great warrior you seek? 

Wars not make one great. 

But soft, no more of 
Talking, for my appetite 
Dinner demandeth. 

Thus shall I explore 

The food thou hast here prepar’d. 

Mmm, and I shall taste. 

Nay, nay, unhand my supper, little one! 

How dost grow so big 
When the food of thy diet 
Is of this strange kind? 

Attend, my friend, thou must leave this alone. 

My food I shall have need of, as we strive 
To free our ship. I did not try to land 
Inside that puddle drear, and if we could 
Our ship remove, we would. But we cannot— 

At least, I know not how it shall be done. 

[Yoda rummages through Luke’s 
supplies, discarding them to the 

ground. 


Unfortunate ship... 

Thou canst not get it out, hmm? 
O, what merry light! 



LUKE

[Yoda removes a light from Luke’s 

supplies. 

A mess thou now hast made! Give me that light! 

’Tis mine, it is mine! 

I shall the pretty thing have 
Or I help you not. 

I need not thine assistance, nay! I need 
My lamp, for it shall guide me out of this 
Most slimy and disgusting hole of mud! 

What slimy, what mud? 

Thou speak’st indeed of my home. 

[R2-D2 reaches out and grabs the 

lamp. 


Alas, naughty droid! 


[R2-D2 and Yoda fight for the 

lamp. 



LUKE 


YODA 


LUKE 


YODA 


O R2, let the creature have it now. 

[R2-D2 releases the lamp. 

Now move along, good fellow. We have much 
To do. Thou art small in both size and help. 

Nay, nay, I shall stay. 

For I shall stay and help thee 
Find thy long lost friend. 

Thou dost not understand, thou useless scamp. 

I search not for a friend in this damp place. 

But for a Jedi master wise in skill! 

O Jedi master! 

Yoda that you seek it is. 

’Tis truly Yoda! 

[aside:] A strange turn of events! This tiny sprite 


LUKE 







YODA 


LUKE 


May yet prove useful if he knows the man. 

[To Yodcu] Attend: thou know’st of Yoda, little 
one? 

I’ll take thee to him. 

Aye, but first, let us eat food. 

Come, I good food have! 

I follow. R2, stay and watch the camp— 

Mayhap some hope still lives within this damp.

Nay, nay, good droid, for thou shalt speak unto 
The Falcon to determine wherefore doth 
The hyperdrive not operate aright. 

For once I find thee useful, goldenrod.

from side to side. 


Sir, it is possible this ast’roid may 
Not be entirely stable. 

—Dost thou think? 

O droid of wisdom, skill, and excellence— 
Howe’er would I survive if I did not 
Have thee here to reveal such mysteries?

It is my heart that I feel quaking. Yet, 

Alas, this moment not befits our love. 

The situation is too strain’d. I wish. 

With all my being, to be in this place— 

But not like this. [To Han:] Pray, let me go. 

—Tut, tut! 

I prithee, let me go.

Be not with such excitement overcome. 

My captain, being held by you is far 
Too plain a thing to e’er excite my mood. 

I crave your kindly pardon, sweetheart fierce. 

But we have little time for something else— 

I’ll leave thee here alone and then, mayhap.

However can I love thee, being as 
You are? But being other than you are, 

I would not love thee. How this pirate hath 
Laid claim upon the bounty of my soul! 

O, wherefore did I speak so testily? 

Why is it that whenever he is near 
My wit is turn’d to unto a laser beam 
With Han plac’d firmly in its sights? I tear 
His heart in twain with words too cruel and 
harsh. 

Then wonder why he is so full of pride. 

’Tis now quite clear that he with arrogance 
Doth speak so that he may his heart protect. 
Forsooth, was e’er a woman placed in 
So delicate a situation yet? 

[Exit Princess Leicu

O, where is that knave R2 now? For when

Perhaps on some adventure, which will serve 
To puff him up most mightily, and leave 
Him ever bragging o’er his exploits. Pish! 

The scrawny, errant scamp perplexes me. 

For he is both my nuisance and delight—

It is as though ’twere programm’d by a thief, 

And spends its days with smugglers, thugs, and 
crooks. 

But now, no more of that; my point is made. 

It doth report the power coupling on 
The axis negative is polariz’d. 

And must replaced be to operate. 

’Tis plain it must replaced be. Presume

As me, at least—the bus’ness of his ship.

Of “she” or “her,” I indicate my ship.

In battles or in races hard to best. 

My swift maneuvers legendary are 
And through the galaxy my ship is known. 

But with this princess, all my skill is naught. 

My tongue is tied, and I resort to barbs 
And witticisms sloppily convey’d. 

How shall I show this princess my true heart? 

How set aside my ego and be kind? 

Here, in this moment, I shall undertake 
To set my pathway not toward my pride. 

But through the smoother course that runs to 
love.

shoved away. 

[To Leicu] Pray patience. Worship, I but try to 
help! 

Couldst thou forswear thy pompous attitude 
And promise thou shalt ne’er call me that name? 

Aye, Leia.

To make him thine, respond thou not with fire. 

[To Han:] You do not make it simple. 

—Yes, ’tis true. 

But ’tis not I alone who is to blame, 

Eor thou couldst softer and more gentle be.

sore hands. 


Occasionally, mayhap, when you are 
Not acting in the manner of a scoundrel. 

[Han Solo takes Leia’s hands in his. 

A scoundrel? “Scoundrel” is the word you choose? 
I like that word, when spoken from your lips. 

Pray cease that touch, it doth my heart confuse. 

But wherefore cease? What reason shall eclipse 
The greater reason of my heart’s intent? 

But lo, my hands are dirtied by my work. 

My hands are likewise dirty. Pray, assent 
Unto this moment. What fear makes you shirk? 

What fear? I tell thee, I am not afraid. 

Did I imagine that your hands did shake? 

Thou likest that I am of scoundrel made. 

Eor thy life could more scoundrel gladly take. 

If thou wouldst cast my suit off, think again— 

I would that thou within me deeper look. 

I tell thee true, that I do like nice men. 

I too am nice.

Then, move the ship out of the ast’roid field 
That I may with my master clearly speak. 

We will, my Lord. 

[Exit Admiral Piett. 

—Now shall I speak with my 
Dread Emperor. The man who gave me life 
When all was lost. The man to whom I owe 
All that I am, and e’er shall be. The man. 

Indeed, who like a father is to me. 

His plans for pow’r and schemes most excellent 
I do obey and carry out with pride. 

Though people fear my aspect bleak and dark. 
They should, more surely, fear what I will do 
When answering his perfect, flawless will. 

For sooner would I sacrifice my life 
Than disobey the word of this great man. 


Enter Emperor Palpatine, in beam. 


What is thy bidding, master pure and true? 
There is a great disturbance in the Force. 

I too have felt it. 

—A new enemy 

Arises, e’en the rebel who destroy’d 

The Death Star—and I have no doubt this boy 

Is kin to Anakin Skywalker. 

[aside:] —O, 

Profoundest revelation! I knew he

Was powerful and bore Sky walker’s name, 

Yet that the boy is kin to Anakin 
I did not see. [To the Emperor:] How is this 
possible? 

You only must within your feelings search, 

Lord Vader. Then shalt thou too know ’tis true. 

He could destroy us. 

—He is but a boy. 

And Obi-Wan no longer is his help. 

The Eorce is strong with him, and mark me well: 
The son of Skywalker must ne’er become 
A Jedi. Dost thou comprehend my words? 

[aside:] I do his meaning understand, and yet 
Another future for this boy I’ll write. 

Not death, but something even greater still. 

It may be that this young Skywalker will 
Still prove to be most worthy of the name. 

[To the Emperor] If he could but be turn’d, an ally 
strong 

He could become. 

—Indeed, thou speakest true. 

The boy may prove himself an asset sure. 

Can it be done? What is thy true reply? 

The boy shall surely join us, or shall die.

SCENE 3. 

Inside Yoda’s homestead. 

Enter Luke Skywalker. 


This creature I have follow’d to his home, 

But still no further answers are reveal’d. 

It seemeth that he stalls in bringing me 
Unto the one I truly hope to see. 

With all that hath befallen in this place 
My patience runneth thin. I’ll press the point. 

Enter Yoda. 


Thy generosity is truly rare, 

I’ll warrant that thy food delicious is. 

Yet neither rhyme nor reason have I heard 
Of wherefore we may not go, even now. 
To see good Master Yoda where he lives. 

Pray, patience, young one. 

For Jedi too must eat—thus 
My good food, eat now. 

How many leagues away is Yoda? Shall 
The journey to him long and per’lous be? 

Not far is Yoda. 

Aye, soon thou shalt be with him. 

First, eat of rootleaf. 



Feast for a Jedi— 

Food that enlivens the mind 
Should thy repast be. 

And now, a question: 

What drives the young man’s heart to 
Learn the Jedi way? 

LUKE This is an inquiry perceptive, friend. 

For I am driv’n by force unto the Force: 

My noble father doth inform my steps. 

YODA Thy father, indeed. 

Powerful Jedi was he. 

Powerful Jedi. 

LUKE Avaunt, thou silly creature, how canst thou 

My father know? Eor surely thou dost not 
E’en know who I am. Eie! I know not what 
Or who or why or when or where or how 
Hath brought about this meeting! Time is short; 
Each minute pass’d with thee hath gone to waste! 

YODA [speaking to the air:] I cannot teach him. 

The boy hath none of patience. 

How shall he be taught? 

The voice of the Ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi is heard. 


OBI-WAN He patience lacks, but patience can be learn’d. 

YODA Much anger in him. 

Sudden and quick in quarrel: 

Too like his father. 



OBI-WAN 

YODA 

LUKE 

YODA 


Was I then difPrent when thou didst teach me? 

He is not ready. 

’Tis now the thing that I see: 

This one’s unprepar’d. 

’Tis Yoda! Nay, but Ben, pray argue for 
My cause, for verily prepar’d am I! 

I can and shall a Jedi be. True, Ben? 

Ready are you, hmm? 

What know you yet of ready? 

Say naught of “ready.” 

For eight hundred years 
Have I the Jedi trained. 

So say not “ready.” 

I my own counsel 

Shall keep on who’s to be trained! 

A Jedi is wise. 

A strong commitment 
And a most serious mind 
Are necessary. 

Long have I watch’d him. 

All his life looking away 
To the future, hmm. 

To the horizon. 

Ne’er his mind on where he was. 

What he was doing! 


Ventures, excitement: 

A Jedi craveth not these. 



OBI-WAN

LUKE

Thou art reckless, aye! 

And so was I, if thou dost think on it. 

And he is too old 

The training to begin now. 

Certain, he’s too old. 

But Master Yoda, I have learn’d so much. 

And will he finish 

The thing he doth begin here? 

I prithee, tell me. 

I shall not fail thee: ’tis my promise true. 
For I am not afraid of anything. 

Thou shalt be yet, Luke. 

My words most carefully heed: 

Thou shalt be, indeed.

Good Sir, if I may venture my belief— 

I tell thee honestly, C-3PO, 

That neither appetite nor inclination 
Have I to feast upon your odd beliefs. 

Do thou thy work but keep opinion out. 
And we shall feast together on the silence. 


Enter Princess Leia, in fear. 


O Han, a horrid sight I have just seen! 

Whilst I did in the cockpit sit and think— 

On what? Pray tell: what didst thou think upon? 

’Tis not the time for jokes and parries, please! 

As I did sit there, suddenly a jolt 

Went through me as I heard a sound upon 

The window. Looking closer, I espied 

A second beast outside that hard upon 

The window fell. There’s something out there, 

Han— 

Beyond the ship, abiding in the cave.

shakes.

Nay, art thou mad? It is not wise or safe 
To go without when there are creatures we 
Know nothing of. 

—This bucket is just fix’d, 

Wouldst thou I let some thing tear it apart? 

I see thy reason, and shall go with thee. 

I shall with courage and with honor stay 
Behind to bravely guard the ship. 

[Another sound is heard. 

O dear! 

[Exit C-3PO as the others go outside 

the ship. 

What is this ground that we do walk upon? 

’Tis strange—it doth not feel at all like rock. 

Indeed, with thine assessment I agree: 

It seems there is much moisture in this place. 

I have a feeling bad about this cave. 

What odd new situation find we here? 

Do not these signs and portents give thee fear? 

Aye. 

[Han sees something move. 


Take thou cover! 



’Tis all right. 


[He shoots.

—What is’t? 

’Tis what I did suspect: some mynocks. They 
Are fasten’d to the ship, a’chewing on 
The power cables. 

—Mynocks? O what beasts! 

Return inside, and we shall search for more. 

[Several mynocks fly by. Han 
shoots, and the cave walls shake. 

But hold one moment, something seems awry, 

Eor blaster fire should not cause walls to shake. 

[Han shoots the cave wall, and the 
ground shakes mightily. 

O, horror, for I now do understand: 

The cave doth quake whenever it is shot. 

But what knows rock of pain, or stone of hurt? 
Whenever did a cave feel anything? 

Impossible it is, unless this cave 
Is much more than a cave. [To Leia and 
Chewbacccu] Pray, go inside! 

[They run into the Millennium 

Ealcon. 

With speed now, Chewie, let us fly away!

Empire is without, we should not 

go—

the ship. 

See reason! Eor thou canst not make the jump 
To lightspeed midst this field of asteroids. 

Make sure thy back end finds a seat—we go! 

[They begin to leave the cave, which 
is actually an exogorth, or space 
slug. Its mouth begins to close. 

Enter C-3PO. 


Observe! We are destroy’d! 

—I see it plain. 

O, we are doom’d! 

—The cave, it doth collapse! 

This is no cave, and I am not its food. 

Now we do fly—another close escape! 

[Exeunt C-3PO, Han Solo, Princess 

Leia, and 

Chewbacca in the Milennium 
Ealcon, flying out 
of exogorth’s mouth and leaving it 

alone on stage. 




EXOGOR. Alas, another meal hath fled and gone, 

And in the process I am sorely hurt. 

These travelers who have escap’d my reach 
Us’d me past the endurance of a block! 

My stomach they did injure mightily 
With jabs and pricks, as though a needle were 
A’bouncing in my belly. O cruel Fate! 

To be a space slug is a lonely lot. 

With no one on this rock to share my life. 

No true companion here to mark my days. 
And now my meals do from my body fly— 
Was e’er a beast by supper so abus’d? 

Was e’er a creature’s case so pitiful? 

Was e’er an exogorth as sad as I? 

Was e’er a tragedy as deep as mine? 




I shall with weeping crawl back to my cave, 
Which shall, sans food, belike become my grave. 

[Exit 



SCENE 5. 

The Dagobah system. 


LUKE 


YODA 


Enter Yoda, R2-D2, and Luke Skywalker, training. 


[aside:] This Yoda is indeed a teacher wise, 
And hath agreed to train me in the way 
Of Jedi. Strong and quick I show myself— 
With leaps and flips I train my body and 
Instill within a Jedi’s discipline. 

Aye, with the Force I like a sand bat fly. 

My spirit feeleth free, my muscles strong. 

My mind is calm inside, my heart is still. 
What gratitude I feel toward this new 
And treasur’d mentor. Thus I train my best— 
His expectations I’ll not disappoint. 

Now run, indeed, run! 

A Jedi’s strength doth surely 
Come from the Force, Luke. 

But mind the dark side. 

Anger, fear, aggression—from 
The dark side are they. 

Easily they flow. 

Quick to join you in a fight. 

Aye, they do not fail! 

Once on the dark path. 

Forever shall it control 



Thy destiny, Luke. 


It shall consume thee, 

As it did the apprentice 
Of good Obi-Wan. 

LUKE Darth Vader: legendary is his pow’r. 

But Master, hath the dark side greater strength? 

YODA Nay, nay—forsooth: nay. 

’Tis quicker, easier, more 
Seductive only. 

LUKE But how, good master, shall I know the good 

Side from the bad, the darkness from the light? 

YODA Thou shalt know, my lad. 

When thou art calm and passive. 

[Aside:] I hope thou shalt know. 

When fac’d with terror. 

And with thy father’s grim fate, 

I hope thou shalt know. 

[To Luke:] A Jedi uses 
The Eorce only for knowledge 
And defense. Is’t clear? 

The Eorce is no club. 

Neither is it a weapon 
Us’d for attacking. 

LUKE Yet it is still a weapon for defense. 

So wherefore may I not the Eorce employ— 

YODA Nay, there’s no wherefore. 



Nothing more shall come today. 
From thy questions, rest. 


LUKE 


YODA 


LUKE 

YODA 


[aside:] Reliev’d am I this training to complete, 

If only for this day, which hath been years. 

But is this not a strange and troubling thing? 
Where only moments past I felt at ease. 

Now there’s some sprite within that troubles me 

A chill, a solemn aura in my bones. 

I would not much ado o’er nothing make. 

But still shall I ask Yoda what it is. 

[To Yodcu] I feel a cold, a presage here of death. 
What is it that I sense within this place? 

[Yoda points to the opening of a 

cave. 


With the Eorce’s dark side 
Is that place yonder quite strong. 

A place of evil. 

Discover thou shalt 

That wherever good is found. 

Evil is nearby. 

Here on Dagobah 

’Tis also so. Eor e’en here 

That evil place is. 

Bound thou art now, Luke, 

To enter it, and face its 
Deepest darknesses. 

But Sir, I prithee, tell me: what’s within? 
Only that which thou 



R2-D2 


LUKE 


Shalt take away with thee, Luke. 

[Luke begins to enter the cave, 
carrying his weapons. 

Take not thy weapons. 

Beep, meep, meep, squeak, beep, whistle, meep, 
beep, nee! 

[Luke enters, bringing his weapons, 
as Yoda and R2-D2 remain outside. 

What twists of knotted vines and tangl’d fates 
Await me in this hole? I shall go in. 

And prove that I am not afraid of it. 

Nor any task or misadventure here. 

What evil can await I have not seen? 

For I have faced evil enemies 
Who kill’d my mentor and my family. 

What evil in this place can greater be? 

Now doth time seem to slowly beat its pace. 

And all is like a thick and restless dream. 

But wait, who comes unto this deep, dark place? 

It moves with grace—is it my father good? 


Enter shadow of Darth Vader. 


Nay, nay, how I have been deceiv’d, abus’d! 
For it is Vader here, my greatest foe. 

The cruel defiler of my father’s youth. 

I stand prepared to do battle as 
A Jedi, full of rage and righteous hate. 

Now up, lightsaber, light my keen revenge! 
Lay on, Darth Vader, damned henchman vile. 
And now we fight! Yet seems it that my limbs 



YODA 


R2-D2 


Are made of stone—but he is slower still! 

I see my chance to strike, and let it fall— 

The blow that shall release my father’s soul. 

Now Vader’s head doth fall onto the ground 
And I feel no relief, but only pain. 

The mask doth split, his visage to reveal! 

O, I shall see the face that kill’d a man. 

That kill’d a thousand fathers like my own. 

But wait, what is this here—and can it be? 

This is no face of Vader: ’tis my face! 

The horror, O the horror! Darker yet 
That e’er I had imagin’d possible. 

The greatest evil I may face—myself! 

[Exit Luke, in fear. 


Now hath he seen it. 

And he shall ever see it 
Till he sees it through. 

[Exit Yoda. 

O strange and somber night that falleth here— 

My master Luke all out of sorts from what 
He spies inside this hole. What lesson is 
It Yoda hath reveal’d to him inside? 

I would that I my master could protect. 

But such is not the role I have to play. 

And thus, since I may not protector be. 

My path shall be to play the fool and watch: 

I shall maintain my droidlike silence and 
Bear witness as the boy becomes the man. 

The learner doth become the Jedi true. 

Content yourself with this, R2, and rest. 

For other times than these require your best. 


[Exit. 



SCENE 6. 

Space, aboard the Empire’s Super Star Destroyer and the Millennium 

Falcon. 

Enter Admiral Piett and Imperial Controller, with Darth Vader and 
Bounty Hunters, including Boba Fett, aside, aboard the Super Star 

Destroyer. 

PIETT 

These bounty hunters, 0 they reek! We have 

No need for their most wretched scum. 

CONTROL. 

—Aye, Sir. 

PIETT 

The rebels surely shall not ’scape us now. 

CONTROL. 

We have been hail’d by the Avenger ship. 

PIETT 

Now let us hear it. 

VADER 

—There shall be rewards 

Aplenty for the one who finds the swift 
Millenn’um Falcon. Ye may use whate’er 
Approaches, weapons, means, or what ye will. 
But mark ye well: I want them all alive. 

[To Boba Fett:] There shall be no disintegrations. 
Clear? 



FETT 


As you wish. [Aside:] The darkest Sith that e’er 
did live, and I am his choice to find those he 
cannot. 

Yet who am I? A mere bounty hunter like the 
others 

here? Nay, far more. I am Boba Fett, the vilest, 
fiercest, most deadly hunter in the galaxy. More 
than that, Darth Vader knows that I shall serve 
him well and faithfully in the pursuit of Solo. He 
knoweth well that Boba Fett doth worship at 
sweet 

compensation’s throne, and would happily 
betray my own kin to earn the great reward 
that hath been promis’d. I would kill Solo 
without a thought, for what is he to me? 
Disintegrations, indeed. I would disintegrate, 
disembowel, dismember, destroy utterly Han 
Solo, 

for I know him not nor care what he hath done 
to earn Darth Vader’s ire and the scorn of Jabba 






of the Hutt. I shall play my bounty hunter’s part, 
obey the dark lord, take my prize from the 
Empire, 

and receive a second prize on the dunes of 
Tatooine. 

A double prize—’tis wonderful a bounty hunter to 
be. 

PIETT [to Darth Vader:] My Lord, the ship hath been 

discovered! 

[Exeunt Darth Vader, Boba Fett, 
other bounty hunters, Admiral Piett, 
and Imperial Controller.

O, praise the maker! We are venturing 
Out of the ast’roid field, and are alive—

That Captain Solo bears a hero’s air. 

Now let us hence. Chewbacca, art prepar’d 
Eor lightspeed?

C-3PO The rear deflector shield is compromis’d. 

And if we do sustain another hit 
Upon the ship’s back quarter, ’tis our end.

But desp’rate times for desp’rate measures call. 
[To Chewbacca:] Turn thou this ship around. 


CHEWBAC. —Egh? 

HAN —Turn it ’round! 

I shall put all our pow’r to shields in front.

I throw myself and all my hopes, dear lord. 

The great Millenn’um Falcon now is fled. 

It hath evaded even our vast fleet.

—The ship is lost? 

And thus thy life—dead for a ducat, dead! 

[Death Vader chokes Captain Needa 
with the Force, killing him. 

The necks of fools deserve a crushing Eorce. 

Let this serve as thy dying lesson, Needa. 

With that last breath thy recompense is done 
And all apologies accepted. 

Enter Admiral Piett. 


—Lord, 

Our scan of the surrounding area 
Is now complete, but has, alas, found naught. 
Lord, if the swift Millenn’um Falcon hath 
Made good the jump to lightspeed, it may be 
Beyond the far end of the galaxy. 

Alert thou every Imperil post. 

And calculate the ship’s most likely course 
Prom its trajectory as it did flee. 

Aye, Lord, I’ll warrant we shall find them soon. 

[Exit Admiral Piett. 

O ancestors, pray save me from these fools 
Who with their instruments and scanners could 
Not find a bantha in a womp rat’s hole. 

But calm thyself now, Vader, be at ease. 



This momentary failure may yet prove 
Most beneficial, and I’ll warrant that 
The time shall not go dully by us, for 
It shall be us’d to finalize my plans 
And think upon the moment when I shall 
Both meet and then defeat the Skywalker 
Who dares to call the Empire enemy. 

So let these rebels go for now, my soul. 

And ponder how to make their downfall whole.

with the Force. 


YODA Use the Force, Luke, yes. 

Now, lift thou the stone. Feel it. 

The Force within flows. 

[R2-D2 begins to beep as Luke’s ship 

sinks. 

Nay, listen thou not 

To the droid and all his beeps. 

Do thou concentrate! 

[Everything that was lifted falls. 

R2-D2 Nee, nee, beep, meep, beep, squeak, squeak, 

whistle, squeak! 

LUKE Fie! We shall never extricate the ship. 

YODA So certain are you? 

Always with you, my pupil. 

It cannot be done.

Possible shall be.

But Master, moving stones with the great Force 
I do admit may be achiev’d. But this, 

This ship—to lift its hulk, its mass, its size— 

’Tis different, aye, wholly different! 

Nay! No different. 

Only within thy mind, Luke, 

Different it is. 

Thou must unlearn all 

Those things that thou hast learned. 

Dost thou understand? 

In troth, I understand, and I shall try. 

Nay, nay! Try thou not. 

But do thou or do thou not. 

For there is no “try.” 

[aside:] I shall stretch out my mind, and shall 
attempt. 

But this is madness—lifting e’en a ship? 

The greatest Jedi still cannot achieve 
That which is patently impossible. 

Methinks no Force can move this ship, and thus 
I certain am I never shall do this. 

[Luke tries to lift the ship with the 
Force, but the ship sinks lower. 


Beep, hoo. 

—Nay, I cannot. ’Tis much too big. 
Nay, size matters not. 



Look thou at me, I prithee. 
Judge me by my size? 


LUKE 


YODA 


LUKE 


And where you should not. 

Eor my ally ’tis the Eorce. 

A pow’rful ally. 

Life doth create it. 

Its energy surrounds us, 

Binds us together. 

Luminous beings 

We are, not this crude matter. 

You must feel the Eorce. 

All around thee, here— 

Between thou and me, tree, rock: 

Ev’rywhere it is. 

E’en between the land 
And your ever-sinking ship. 

The Eorce is there, too. 

I know now thou dost ask th’impossible. 

[Luke sits aside, as Yoda lifts his 

hands. 


[aside:] Be mindful, young one. 

And watch what inner strength great 
May come from small size. 

[Yoda moves the ship out of the 
swamp using the Force. 

The ship! It cometh out—thou hast done it! 

I ne’er imagin’d it was possible. 

With eyes I see, but mind does not believe. 



YODA 


Thus is your error. 

Against the Force you do rail; 
That is why you fail.

Great thanks I give thee for the gift of peace. 

Brave soul, what dost thou think thou next shalt 
do? 

Before these ships do from the fleet release. 

They should their garbage dump ere they pursue 
A jump to lightspeed. Then well float away. 

Thy ship with all the garbage, eh? Well said. 

And what then? 

—We shall haply find our way 
Unto a port where safety makes its bed. 

Pray, dost thou know of any port like such? 

Mayhap I might, if I knew where we were. 

Anoat system, but doth that help much? 

O, the Anoat system? I aver: 

’Tis bleak. 

—But hark! An interesting name 
My ship’s computer showeth: Lando! 


—Han? 

What Lando system?

—“System,” you exclaim? 

He is not system: Lando is a man. 

As Lando of Calrissian he’s known. 

The man doth deal in cards, in gambling and 
In scoundreling—thou wouldst his type condone. 

[aside:] He jests with me as one in love’s 
command! 

He is in Bespin—rather far, but we 
May make it there. 

[reading from screen:] —^A colony? A mine? 

Tibanna gas mine—I would wager he 

Hath ta’en the mine that someone did call “mine.” 

This Lando hath a hist’ry long with me. 

But dost thou trust him? 

—Nay, thou’rt right. But I 
Believe we have no need of fear, for he 
No love doth harbor for the Empire, aye. 

[The ship shakes. 

[Into comlink:] Prepare now, Chewie, ’tis the 
time. Detach! 

[The Millennium Ealcon detaches 
from the Star Destroyer. 

Thou hast these moments that are unsurpass’d— 
Aye, when thou hast them, they are without 
match. 

Not numerous are they, but aye: thou hast. 

[Leia kisses Han and exits with C-

HAN 


FETT 


’Tis said that sometimes those who knew us in 
Our youth did know us best. From them we have 
No secrets and cannot pretend to be 
Another thing than what we are. They keep 
Our living honest, for they know who we 
Have been. And such a man is Lando. He 
And I have known each other many years, 

So he doth know me from my smuggling past. 

The days when I did gamble, cheat, and fight— 
And often in that order, too. He knew 
Me ere I was with the Rebellion join’d. 

And knoweth what Han Solo once hath been. 

Thus is he prim’d uniquely to give aid 
Unto a friend who now hath found a cause: 

A cause to join, a cause e’en to defend. 

O Lando, all our hopes are pinn’d on thee. 

What shall it be, old friend? I here take all 
I have—my ship, my mates, my one true love— 
And stake it all on thee and on our past. 

How shalt thou answer, O Calrissian? 

Will this, my wager, prove a foolish bet? 

How shall the deck unfold, the players end? 

And is the dealing in my favor stack’d? 

The playing of the game is yet to be. 

But Lando: I do seek to win with thee. 

[Exit 


Enter Boba fett. 


A smuggler’s ways are e’er unchanging and 
predictable. Thou hast let the Millennium Ealcon 
go out with the refuse. Solo, but I refuse to let 
thee play a jade’s trick and go thy merry way. 
Thy course shall I pursue, and e’en best, for my 



ship is swift of flight unlike thy tir’d and aged 
Falcon. To the last I’ll grapple with thee, and 
in the heart of Bespin make thee cold with fright. 
The Fett doth promise it, and it shall be. 

[Exit Boba Fett. 



SCENE 2. 

The Dagobah system. 


Enter Yoda, r2-d2, and Luke Skywalker, doing a handstand and lifting 

things with the Force. 


YODA Now, concentrate, Luke. 

Feel the Force, how it doth flow. 
Be calm, at peace, yes. 

When you use the Force, 

The Force, in your soul, begins 
New paths to open. 

Through the Force, your mind 
Shall see future things, things past. 
Friends nearer and yon.

Alas, my mind doth see—’tis Leia, Han! 

[Everything drops as Luke’s 
concentration breaks. 


Nay, be in control! 

Thou must, beyond all else, Luke, 

Have control entire. 

O vision most horrendous and most drear. 

A city in the clouds most beautiful. 

Beneath a golden sun—as though ’twere heav’n. 
But hidden just beneath its luster doth 
A harsh and painful nightmare lurk. I saw. 
Beneath a sky of orange hues array’d. 

Dear Leia weeping at some cruel, dark thing— 
She will not be consol’d from her great loss. 

And Han, his screams do echo in mine ears. 

Such cries of suffering I ne’er have heard. 

What signs are these, what ghosts of future hurt? 
What doth the Eorce attempt to show to me? 

O tell me. Master, tell me plain, I pray: 

Shall Han and Leia die, is that their fate? 

A future sight, this. 

Hard to see is the future— 

’Tis e’er in motion. 

I understand ’tis hard for thee to see. 

But harder yet the vision echoes in 
My head, and reaches deep within my soul. 

If thou canst not give reassurance they 
Are safe, and shall be safe, ’tis I who must 
Ensure the same. I will not idly stand 
By whilst they suffer many agonies. 

My mind is settl’d: I must thither go.

YODA 


LUKE 


Decide thou must, how 

Thou shalt truly serve them best. 

Mayhap you may help. 

But also shalt thou 
Sacrifice all for which they 
Shall fight and suffer. 

But Master, tell me what then I should do? 
Wouldst thou allow thy friends to suffer thus? 
Wouldst thou accept the future’s “hard to see”? 
Wouldst thou ignore the screams within thy 
brain? 

[aside:] The boy doth not hear— 

His friends’ fates I cannot see. 

But his looketh bleak. 

Convince him I must. 

Else he shall suffer greatly 
And lost is our hope. 

[To Luke:] Go not, I prithee. 

The training must thou complete. 

To my words listen! 

The vision shall not, will not, leave my head. 
E’en now I witness Leia in her torment. 

And Han, alone, as if upon some isle. 

E’en brave Chewbacca cries for what is lost— 
These signs can only equal tragedy. 

They are my friends, and I must fly with haste. 
Or else. I’ll warrant, all of them may die. 


Enter Ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi. 




OBI-WAN Thou canst not know this, Luke. E’en Yoda doth 

Not have the pow’r, their final fate to see. 

LUKE But I may help them now; I feel the Eorce! 

OBI-WAN To see is one thing—to control is yet 

Another. Dangerous this moment is 

Eor thee, for thou shalt be sore tempted, in 

Thy rage, toward the dark side of the Eorce. 

YODA Yes, to Obi-Wan 

Thou must listen. The cave, Luke: 

Recall thy failure! 

LUKE But truly, I have learn’d so much since then. 

I know what I must watch for and beware, 

I know how tempted by the dark I’ll be. 





I know this and shall, therefore, guard my soul. 
I tell thee. Master Yoda, I’ll return 

And finish all my training. This I vow. 

OBI-WAN 

Pray, open up thine eyes. ’Tis thee and thine 
Abilities the Emperor desires. 

They are the bait, and thou the coIo claw— 
Thou art the fish the Emperor would catch. 

Thy friends do suffer only for thy sake. 

So that, through them, thou mayst be easily 
Drawn in. 

LUKE 

—^And that is why I have to go. 

Present unto the Emperor the fish. 

And rest assur’d the bait is off the hook. 

OBI-WAN 

0 Luke, I would not lose thee as I lost 

Darth Vader. His betrayal made my life 

A bleak and tragic thing. Thy loss unto 

The dark would make my death a hellish, cold 
Eternity. 

LUKE 

—I shall return, dear Ben. 

My training thus far shall suffice, it is 

Enough; I stand prepar’d to face the dark. 

YODA 

Stopped they must be; 

On this depends ev’ry thing. 

But pray, attend me: 


Only a fully 

Trained Jedi may defeat 

Vader and his Lord. 


If thou leavest now. 

And here do end thy training. 



Thou art choosing ease.

And once on the path 
Of ease and haste, like Vader 
Thou mayst become, Luke. 

Attend to Yoda’s wisdom, Luke, and stay. 

O, exercise thy patience, worthy lad. 

And in the waiting sacrifice my friends? 

Is that the choice that ye would have me make? 

This hard indeed is. 

But if thou honor the thing 
Eor which they fight: yes. 

If thou dost choose to face Darth Vader, thou 
Shalt be alone; I cannot interfere. 

I understand, and have been fully warn’d. 

My mind is set; good R2, do prepare. 

Eire up the ship’s converters: we depart. 

O, do not give in unto hate, dear Luke, 

In doing so the dark side shalt thou find. 

[Aside:] Indeed, I once did see it happen thus. 

Strong is Darth Vader. 

Remember what thou hast learn’d, 

Eor save thee it can. 

I shall, and shall return: you have my word. 

[Exeunt Luke and R2-D2. 


Warned thee I have— 
He a reckless spirit hath. 



Now matters are worse. 


OBI-WAN 

YODA 


That boy is our first, last, and greatest hope. 

[Exit Ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi. 


But nay, ’tis not so. 

For another yet there is: 

One more hope for us. 

O how this plagues me! 

The boy for training hath come. 

But too soon is fled. 

A young bird he is. 

Too eager the nest to leave. 

Yet trying to fly. 

But young birds fly not— 

Their wings still too fragile are. 

Instead, they do fall. 

And fall this one shall. 

But how far, how fast, how long? 

Time only shall tell. 

Little bird, be safe. 

If thou the nest seest again 
I shall meet thee then.

Nay, who hath worri’d? [Aside:] Verily, there is

Our troubl’d quest—I shall not doubt him now.

Egh. 

—O, there is no one to meet us here. 

I do not like this, Han. 

—What wouldst thou like? 

At least we are no more upon the ship— 
Enough of space I’ve seen to last a life. 
’Twas kind of them to let us land.

Yet I am neither rested nor relax’d.

My mind is sore afeard, my hands do shake. 
And nowhere can my troubl’d soul find peace. 
The quick permission given us to land. 

The too-familiar welcome Lando gave, 

A small apartment offer’d for our use— 

It seems as though we were expected here. 
Though how this could have happen’d, I know 
not. 

Por surely when th’Imperi’l fleet broke up. 

We in the opposite direction flew. 

But e’en beyond that worry there is more,

Awry. Where is C-3PO? He hath 

Not seen us or been seen for many hours, 

And no one knows about his way or path. 

Hath he lost all his faithful, droidly sense? 

Most happ’ly would I by him be annoy’d. 

If it did mean that he, at least, were near. 

I shall inquire of Lando ’bout the droid. 

But in the meantime, Leia, have no fear. 

I trust not Lando. 

—Neither, sweet, do I, 

Yet he’s my friend who helpeth us, dost see? 

I’ll warrant that we soon from here shall fly. 

Then thou shalt take thy flight as well—from me.

That they unto the code this city built 
Is not the thing that I found strange. Instead, 

It was the code’s requirements I did mark. 

For didst thou know the Empire doth require 
That any major structure shall include 
At least one chasm that’s deep and long and dark? 
Not only shall these chasms exist: the code 
Doth further specify that they shall be 
Abutting pathways where pedestrians 
May walk. The Death Star that was built some 
years 

Ago had, evidently, sev’ral of 

These holes, and our Gloud Gity has them, too. 

Is not this strange? 

—I know them well, and did 
Go walking past just such a gaping hole 
That led to nothingness but yesterday. 

But wherefore dost thou say ’tis strange, I pray? 

It simply maketh little sense to put 
Such vast, deep holes in ev’ry structure next 
To well-worn paths. Gould not a person, by 
Some simple misstep, fall most easily 
Down one of these great chasms? So wherefore 
place 

Such hazards into ev’ry structure built? 

I see your reasoning, but shall rebut: 

The Empire is the greatest strength e’er known, 
’Tis true? 

—Of course. I’d not say otherwise. 

And any great thing—person, beast, or realm— 
Doth put its greatness on display, agreed? 



’Tis natural, I’ll warrant. Pray, say on. 

GUARD 2 

GUARD 1 I posit that the Empire doth command 

That structures have these chasms immense 
because 

It is through their immensity that our 
Great Empire’s strength is shown. And since they 
are 

Vast holes that deadly are, should one fall in. 

They send a message strong and clear to all: 

The Empire is a proud and mighty pow’r 
And doth not fear sure death, but laughs at it. 
r faith, we are so full of life that we 
Walk by our certain passing daily—it 
Is but quotidian for us—and yet 
We have no fear. 

GUARD 2 —Thy point is clearly made. 

But still, I think it strange that this is true: 

A structure is not whole till it hath holes. 

Such things lie far beyond my understanding. 

Yet do I trust there is a master plan. 

GUARD 1 Shall we to supper, friend? 

GUARD 2 —Eorsooth, lead on!

Yet ever shall my soul be haunted by 
These dismal howls of my old friend, unless 
I can find some way to make recompense. 

But how shall that e’er be whilst Vader’s threats 
Do cast their shadows o’er my ev’ry move? 

I know not how, but yet it must be so. 

I shall—belike with loyal Lobot’s help— 
Discover yet a way to make this right. 

And save myself from a betrayer’s name! 


Enter Lobot, Darth Vader, and Boba Fett. 


[to Boba Few] Thou mayst take Captain Solo and 
transport 

Him unto Jabba once Sky walker has 
Arriv’d and captur’d been. Say, is this clear? 

’Tis, my Lord. But Solo is no good to me, should 
he be dead upon delivery. He hath been tortur’d 
severely in this last hour. ’Tis well, but I prithee 
do 

not kill the man ere I deliver him to Jabba. 

No harm beyond undoing shall he bear. 

Lord Vader, do I comprehend this fully— 

Thou shalt surrender Han unto this man. 

This bounty hunter here? So what is next?

I prithee, tell me: what shall happen to 
Both Leia and the Wookiee? 

—Never shall 
They leave this city. 

—This doth push the bounds 
Too far! Imprisonment was never a 
Condition of the bargain we did make, 

And ’twas not in the plan to hand o’er Han 
Unto this bounty hunter! 

—Mayhap thou 

Dost think thou hast unfairly treated been? 

[aside:] A threat is in his voice and aspect. [To 
Vader:] 

Nay, 

Eor I shall model flexibility. 

’Tis well. ’Twould be a pity should I feel 
It necessary to retain a full 
And armor’d garrison in Bespin. [To Boba Fell:] 
Come!

He orders what he will sans sense or rhyme— 
This deal is worse becoming all the time!

Egh! 

—O, ’tis better! That is quite improv’d. 

But hold, for something is not right: my eyes— 

I cannot see. 

[Chewbacca adjusts C-3PO. 

Now that is mended, aye. 

Yet wait, I now am backward—head is back 
And front’s reverse and all has gone awry! 

Is this a Wookiee’s notion of a joke? 

Thou stupid, senseless beast! 

[laughing:] —Gihut, gihut! 

Thou furball wretched! Mophead ignorant! 

[Chewbacca switches off C-3PO. 


Enter Han Solo, carried by stormtroopers, who drop him and exit

—O, Chewie, I’m in agony— 

My ev’ry bone and sinew cries with pain. 


Enter Princess Leia. 


LEIA What have they done to you, my noble man? 

And what can be their purpose, dost thou know? 

HAN ’Twas torture unlike any I have known, 

Eor never any questions did they ask. 

Instead, with silent mouths and darting eyes 
They fix’d me solidly unto a seat 
And lower’d me unto a mechanism. 

At first ’twas like a searing heat that rac’d 
From skin to bone and back again. Then sparks 
Flew out, upon my chest and neck and face. 

Such fire as though a hundred blasters spread 
Their shots across my body or, perhaps. 

As though a million tiny lightsabers 

Did prick and dance their way about my skin. 

All this they did, but ne’er made inquiry. 

Ne’er ask’d me whence we came or where we go. 
Ne’er ask’d about the rebels’ rendezvous. 

No information they did seek to know. 

It only seem’d they wish’d to bring me pain. 

I tell thee, ’twas far worse and terrible 

Than if they had sought answers from my blood. 

But this demented evil shakes my soul. 

For wherefore torture without questioning?

What dost thou mean by “o’er to me”? Thou

I would not turn a rival o’er to thee. 

Much less the ones beloved by my heart. 

They must stay here, but will, at least, be safe. 
’Twas not my choice—I have no say in this. 

’Tis Vader who doth pull the strings, and we

To put this vexing Skywalker on ice

Lord Vader—there’s a ship that doth approach. 

An X-wing class. 

—’Tis well. Watch Skywalker,

[Exit Imperial soldier. 

Lord Vader, this facility has ne’er 

Been us’d for humans, only carbon freezing. 

If thou dost put him in this vast machine 
It may not freeze him, but may mean his death. 

This is a point that I consider’d not. 

It seems, Calrissian, that thou dost learn 
To be obedient unto thy Lord. 

’Tis well, and it is in thine interest. 

I do not wish him harm’d; the Emperor 
Shall not enjoy a damag’d prize. So shall 
Another stand for him to be a test— 

We shall make Captain Solo undergo 
The freezing process first, to test its pow’r.

LUKE Yes, now am I in Bespin—more fool I, 

For though my feelings say this is the place, 

I know not yet for certain if it be. 

My friends I have not heard from, hide nor hair. 
And yet the Force doth call in clearest tones 
As if to say: “Here lies thy destiny!” 

[Luke sees Bespin guards carrying 

Han Solo. 

But wait, what’s this? Procession most sincere. 

And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken 
The corpse they follow was an enemy.

Aha! It seems that I expected am—

C-3PO At least thou art still in one piece—observe 

My sad fragmented fate! 

[They arrive at the east platform to 
see Boba Fett’s ship flying away. 

LEI A [aside:] —O flown, alack! 

My Han—his body flown and fled. Now break 
My heart, and weep mine eyes. A princess I 
May be, but first and foremost human with 
Emotions that betray my higher sense. 

O gracious Han, forgive that I did come 
To love thee late, and only then to lose thee. 

I’ll find thee in the stars, my Han—I’ll search

One moment for the greater good. [Into comlink:] 
Hear ye,

The Empire doth control the city now— 

I do advise ye all: evacuate 

At once, before more troops arrive within.

LUKE 


Enter Luke Skywalker. 


Where am I now, and where are all my friends? 
Some wrong turn have I ta’en, and now am lost 
Within a cavern, dark and fill’d with mist. 

R2 is left behind; I am alone. 

What evil lurks within this passage bleak? 

What fate shall I discover in this place? 

What pow’r hath brought me here—is it the 
Force? 

If not, what messenger of darkness vile 
Hath giv’n me up unto this realm of fear? 

The cold I feel is as on Dagobah, 

When in the cave my darkest self I fac’d. 

The thoughts I thought therein do now return. 
The questions that did rise and give me pause: 
O, what is life, and what our purpose here? 

Are living creatures made for pain and strife. 

Do we but walk our days upon the ground 
To perish without memory or fame? 

If so, what shall we seek whilst we yet live? 

Is brave adventure worthy of our time. 

Or should we seek the principle of pleasure? 
Are family and children noble aims. 

Or is the Force itself our holy goal? 

Is life a quest or is it but a farce— 

A splendid journey or a fool’s crusade? 



VADER 


Such questions plague my soul, and make me 
doubt. 

They draw my mind toward the darkest thoughts 
That e’er I’ve known since I became a man. 

And here, away from Dagobah, I have 
No firm assurance of my safety, nor 
The comfort of my master being here. 

Thus shall I face my fortune by myself. 

Without my mentors great to give me help. 

The thought doth bring me trepidation, for 
I have relie’d upon their counsel wise. 

Be with me here in spirit, if not form. 

Good Obi-Wan and Yoda—masters true. 

O life, O Fate! I would I knew my place. 

My time, my end, my destiny complete— 

But I cannot see why or how life is. 

Because the past is not a perfect guide. 

And since the future still remains unknown: 

My fate shall I meet in the present tense. 

[A sound is heard. 

But soft, I hear slow footsteps drawing near. 


Enter Darth Vader. 


The Force is with thee now, young Sky walker. 

In troth—but thou art not a Jedi yet.

LUKE 


O mighty duel, O action ne’er surpass’d: 

The lightsabers do clash and glow like fire. 

Darth Vader in the villain’s role is cast, 

While Luke’s young temper turneth soon to ire. 
They flash and fly like dancers in a set. 

Yet never dance did know such deadly mood. 

Luke tires, and soon his brow begins to sweat. 
Whilst Vader doth attack with strength renew’d. 

Forsooth, young one, ’tis plain thou hast learn’d 
much. 

Thou shalt find me full of surprises yet! 

Thy destiny doth lie with me, Skywalker. 

Your teacher Obi-Wan did know ’twas true. 

Thou liest, O thou villain cruel and cold. 

[They duel tmd Luke falls into the 
carbon freezing machine. 

[aside:] ’Twas far too simple, trapping him within. 
Perhaps the boy is not as powerful 
As my great Emperor and I did think. 

[Luke leaps out of the carbon 
freezing machine. 

I am not captur’d yet, thou lord of hate. 

Thou must another evil scheme derive 
To catch me in thy snares. For I am quick. 

And move with all the power of the Force. 



VADER Impressive, most impressive, worthy lad. 

Thine Obi-Wan hath taught thee well, and thou 
Hast master’d all thy fears. Now, go! Release 
Thine anger, for thy hate alone can strike 
Me down! [Aside:] Now ’tis the moment to 
provoke 

His inner rage. Come walls, machines, and parts 
And come at him from ev’ry side. He’ll be 
Made weak, and in his weakness darkness find! 

[Darth Vader uses the Force to strike 
Luke with nearby objects. 

LUKE Alas, I fall—O Eate, be on my side! 

[Luke falls out a window. 

VADER The battle goes exactly as foreseen. 

The boy is powerful and skill’d, ’tis true. 

But his young powers are no match for mine. 

It seems that Obi-Wan was weak with age, 

Eor this boy’s training still is incomplete. 

He shall be turned yet, for I still hold 
The news that shall undo him utterly. 

He thinks the speed of my lightsaber and 
My power to send objects hurtling at 
Him are the worst that I can muster, but 
My greatest weapon yet shall break his soul. 

Not touch his body. He shall know the truth. 

But even as I plan to share with him 
The story of his father, I must pause. 

The strange confusion I before have felt 
Hath come again into my mind. What is’t? 

I know no better Eate for him and me 
Than to be join’d in service to my Lord 
And Emperor. So why am I confus’d? 

Enough of this now, Vader: finish it. 



The boy shall turn or he shall be destroy’d. 

[Exit Darth Vader. Luke begins to 
climb through the window. 

LUKE O pain, O bitter weariness. I did 

Not know the power of the Force till now— 

Till it, to purpose rank, was turn’d on me! 

Now for my very life I grasp and hold 
Unto the precipice whereon I cling. 

Be with me now, O Ben, restore my strength. 

I see that Vader hath ta’en flight, yet it 
Is plain he doth but wait for his next chance. 

Some hope remains, e’en now, amidst my fear— 
He may yet be defeated, all’s not lost. 

I have regain’d my footing, and may rest 
Until the fight must be resum’d. Now quick: 

Look deep within your heart, Luke, and recall 
The teachings of your gentle master Yoda. 

Breathe deeply and call on the Force, that it 
May show to thee the path that thou must take. 

O, give me strength to win this battle now 
Or, if not win, maintain my sense of right. 

But lo, Darth Vader cometh once again! 

Enter Darth Vader. They duel ond Luke is forced to the edge of a deep 

cavern. 


VADER This is the end for thee, Skywalker. See, 

Thou art defeated now; resistance would 
Be futile. Let yourself not be destroy’d 
As Obi-Wan did, weak old man he was. 

[They duel Darth Vader cuts off 
Luke’s right hand with his lightsaber. 




LUKE O horror! O vast pain exceeding words! 

VADER Thou shalt find no escape. Do not make me 

Destroy thee. Great importance shalt thou have 
Within the Empire’s power, and thine own

[To Luke:] If thou but knewest all the power of 
The dark side. Obi-Wan hath never told 
Thee of what happen’d to thy father, Luke. 

O, he hath spoken much. And he hath told 
Me of the truth—that thou didst slay him, aye. 
And without cause or mercy, murderer 
Most vile and wretched! 

—No, I am thy father. 

Nay, ’tis not true! It is impossible! 

Pray, search thy feelings, Luke. Thou knowest it 
Is true. 

—Nay! 

—Luke, thou mayst the Emperor 
Destroy; he hath foreseen what thou wouldst do. 
It is thy destiny, come join with me— 

Together we shall rule the galaxy 
As son and father. Come now, Luke, it is 
The only way: the dark side is thy path. 

O join with me, and we shall be as one.

Earewell, the former Lando, lonely man! 



Farewell to selfish pride and high ambition! 
Farewell to scoundrelhood and avarice! 

Farewell to all the things my life has been!

I’ll meet thee where we plann’d—on Tatooine—

Dear Chewie, I’ll await thy signal. 

—Auugh! 

Now take thou care—the Eorce be with ye both. 

[They move to separate parts of the 

stage. 


Now ends this troubl’d time of Empire’s rise. 

Our time of harsh betrayal, painful loss. 

Now have we learn’d what friendship truly costs. 
And in the learning lost a comrade strong. 

Along the way, our hearts were moved much: 

By sacred love, most wondrous to behold. 

By bravery that shall outlive the times. 

By sacrifice of our most precious friends. 

Encounters unexpected we did meet 
With masters wise and persons unforeseen. 

These are the star wars, yet they are not done— 
Eor sure, the final chapter’s just begun. 

Enter chorus as epilogue. 


A glooming peace this morning with it brings. 
No shine of starry light or planet’s glow. 



For though our heroes ’scape the Empire’s slings, 
The great rebellion ne’er has been so low. 

Brave Han is for the Empire’s gain betray’d, 
Which doth leave Princess Leia’s heart full sore. 
Young Luke hath had his hand repair’d, remade— 
The man is whole, but shaken to the core. 

Eorgive us, gentles, for this brutal play. 

This tale of sorrow, strife, and deepest woes. 

Ye must leave empty, sighing lack-a-day. 

Till we, by George, a brighter play compose. 

Our story endeth, though your hearts do burn. 
And shall until the Jedi doth return. 

[Exeunt omnes.

AFTERWORD. 


A Winter’s Tale, indeed: William Shakespeare’s The Empire 
Striketh Back. Let me lift the curtain a bit to tell you about 
four aspects of what you’ve just read. 

First of all: what does Yoda sound like in a galaxy filled 
with Elizabethan speech? This was the question that 
gnawed at me as I began to write this second Star Wars 
book. Yoda is famous for his inverted phrase order, but 
many people who read William Shakespeare’s Star Wars 
commented that every character in it sounds a little like 
Yoda. So what to do? Originally, I had four different ideas: 

• Do a complete reversal and have Yoda talk like a 
modern person: “Stop it. Don’t try, just either do it 
or don’t do it. Seriously.” 

• Have Yoda talk in something like Old English, 
approximating Chaucer: “Nee, do ye nae trie, aber 
due it Oder due it not.” (My Chaucer admittedly 
isn’t great.) 

• Don’t do anything special, and have Yoda talk like 
the other characters. 

• Repeat Yoda’s lines verbatim from the movie, 
nodding to the fact that Yoda already sounds a 
little Shakespearean. 



In the end, as you’ve read, I had a fifth idea, which I 
hope was better than any of these. Yoda is a wise teacher, 
almost like a sensei —he has something of an eastern 
sensibility about him. Why not express that by making all 
of his lines haiku? Yes, I know: Shakespeare never wrote in 
haiku. But he did break from iambic pentameter in certain 
cases—Puck from A Midsummer Night’s Dream speaks in 
iambic tetrameter, songs in several Shakespearean works 
break meter, and so on. And yes, I know: the five-seven- 
five syllable pattern I adhere to in Yoda’s haiku is a 
modern constraint, not part of the original Japanese poetic 
form. Most haiku are simpler than Yoda’s lines and do not 
express complete sentences as Yoda’s haiku do—I know, I 
know! Remember, this isn’t scholarship; it’s fun. For you 
purists: 

If these haiku have offended. 

Think but this, and all is mended: 

That you have but slumber’d here 
While these haiku did appear... 

Second, William Shakespeare’s The Empire Striketh Back 
introduces us to the first character in my Shakespearean 
adaptations who speaks in prose rather than meter: Boba 
Fett. Shakespeare often used prose to separate the lower 
classes from the elite—kings spoke in iambic pentameter 
while porters and gravediggers spoke in prose. In writing 
William Shakespeare’s Star Wars, I did not want to be 
accused of being lazy about writing iambic pentameter, 
but with this book it was time to introduce some prose. 



who better to speak in base prose than the basest of 
bounty hunters? 

Third, one criticism of William Shakespeare’s Star Wars I 
heard several times—and took to heart—was that I 
overused the chorus to explain the action sequences. Some 
argued that I shouldn’t have used a chorus at all, which I 
disagree with; when I began writing the first book, the 
chorus seemed like a logical way to “show” the action 
scenes without actually showing them, and there was 
precedent in Shakespeare’s Henry V. However, by leaning 
heavily on the chorus, I neglected another Shakespearean 
device, of having a character describe action that the 
audience can’t see. Here’s an example from Hamlet, Act IV, 
scene 7, in which Gertrude describes what happened to 
Ophelia: 

There is a willow grows aslant a brook. 

That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream; 

There with fantastic garlands did she come 

Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long 
purples 

That liberal shepherds give a grosser name. 

But our cold maids do dead men’s fingers call 
them: 

There, on the pendant boughs her coronet 
weeds 

Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke; 

When down her weedy trophies and herself 



Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread 
wide; 

And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up: 

Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes; 

As one incapable of her own distress. 

Or like a creature native and indued 
Unto that element: but long it could not be 
Till that her garments, heavy with their drink, 

PulTd the poor wretch from her melodious lay 
To muddy death. 

This device is called on more frequently in William 
Shakespeare’s The Empire Striketh Back, giving the chorus a 
needed break. 

Fourth, Lando. As much as I like Billy Dee Williams, and 
as smooth as he was in 1980, in my opinion his character 
isn’t fleshed out very well. We never know what he was 
thinking when he was forced to betray his friend, or what 
made him decide to help Leia and Chewbacca in the end. 
Filling in some of Lando’s story with asides and soliloquies 
that show how conflicted he feels hopefully gives him 
some depth and makes him even more compelling than in 
the movie. 

Once again, writing William Shakespeare’s The Empire 
Striketh Back was a delight. Most Star Wars fans agree that 
Empire is the best of the original trilogy, and I hope I’ve 
done it justice. I say “most Star Wars fans” because in fact. 
Empire is not my personal favorite. I prefer Return of the 
Jedi, thanks in large part to two things. First, it is the first 



Star Wars movie I saw in the theater (I was six). Second, 
when I was growing up we owned a VHS tape of From Star 
Wars to Jedi: The Making of a Saga, and I loved hearing 
about the seven puppeteers who made Jabba move, seeing 
how the rancor came to life, learning how the speeder bike 
sequences were done, and so on. 

That said, of the three movies. Empire has the most 
Shakespearean themes—betrayal, love, battles, destiny, 
teachers, and pupils. All of those, plus the shocking father- 
son relationship. In some ways. Empire follows an ancient 
story form that Shakespeare used: a classic tragedy, with 
Luke Sky walker as the tragic hero. He is like the Greek 
tragic hero Oedipus, who learns only too late that his 
mother is his wife and tears out his eyes after she hangs 
herself. Luke discovers that Darth Vader is his father just 
after losing a hand—close enough, right? Luke also 
demonstrates some serious hubris, just like Oedipus: he 
faces Darth Vader before being truly ready, despite the 
objections of the two remaining Jedi in the entire galaxy. 
And he pays the tragic price for it. Along the way, Han 
Solo is put on ice and Leia’s and Chewbacca’s hearts are 
broken. All the heroes will, of course, live on, and the 
tragedy will turn toward Darth Vader’s redemption in 
Return of the Jedi, but when you take Empire as a single 
unit, the tragedy is Luke’s, and the rebels see the worst of 
things by far. 

Thank you for continuing this adventure with me. I hope 
William Shakespeare’s The Empire Striketh Back offers plenty 
for both Star Wars fans and Shakespeare fans to 
appreciate. For instance, I hope talking wampas, AT-ATs, 
and space slugs (to say nothing of singing Ugnaughts) 
bring a smile to your face. And did you notice whom Han 



and Leia sound like once they start getting romantic? 
(Hint: look at the line endings.) 

The positive response to William Shakespeare’s Star Wars 
was a gift to me as a writer; I hope my retelling of Empire 
(and Return of the Jedi, coming soon) is a fitting thank-you. 



ACKNOWLEDGMENTS. 

So many people provided love, support, and 
encouragement for the release of William Shakespeare’s Star 
Wars and the writing of William Shakespeare’s The Empire 
Striketh Back that this book would be twice as long if I 
tried to name them all. 

Thank you to the amazing people at Quirk Books who 
make the Shakespeare’s Star Wars world go round: Jason 
Rekulak and Rick Chillot (the best editors a guy could ask 
for), publicity manager extraordinaire Nicole De Jackmo, 
the epic Eric Smith, and everyone else at Quirk. Thank you 
to my agent, Adriann Ranta, for hearing every idea—even 
the crazy ones—and responding to them gracefully—even 
the crazy ones. Thanks to Jennifer Heddle at Lucasfilm 
and, once again, to incredible illustrator Nicolas Delort. 

Unending thanks to my college professor and friend, 
Murray Biggs, who once again reviewed my manuscript to 
improve the Shakespearean elements of the book. He 
confessed to me, after reading William Shakespeare’s Star 
Wars, that he has never seen the Star Wars movies but said, 
“I have a feeling about that Luke and Leia.” I hope Empire 
hasn’t crushed that romantic hope too harshly. (And wait 
until he reads Jedi —gasp!) Huge thanks are also due to my 
friend Josh Hicks, who has been my confidant for ideas 
about these books ever since I had the inspiration for 
William Shakespeare’s Star Wars. Josh and I have spent 
endless hours watching and discussing the Star Wars 
movies (like all true geeks), and he has been a constant 



encouragement. Thank you, Josh—now let’s finish that 
children’s book. 

My parents, Beth and Bob Doescher, are my biggest fans 
and let me know how proud they are every time I see 
them. I know how rare it is to have parents who love you 
deeply and let you know it, and I don’t take it for granted. 
To my brother Erik Doescher, my aunt Holly Havens, and 
my dear college friends Heidi Altman, Chris Martin, Naomi 
Walcott, and Ethan Youngerman: thank you for continuing 
to show your love and support as one turned to three. 

I have been blessed throughout my life by wonderful 
teachers and mentors: Jane Bidwell, Betsy Deines, Doree 
Jarboe, Chris Knab, Bruce McDonald, Janice Morgan, and 
Larry Rothe top the list. Thank you all so, so much for the 
lessons in school and life. 

A big thank-you to the Star Wars fans who embraced 
William Shakespeare’s Star Wars (and me) so warmly. You 
are an amazing group of people. Special shout-out to the 
worldwide members of the 501st Legion, and especially 
the 501 St’s Cloud City Garrison in Portland, Oregon. 

Thank you also to so many who offered their kindness 
and assistance: Audu Besmer, Travis Boeh, Chris Buehler, 
Erin Buehler, Nathan Buehler, Jeff and Caryl Creswell, 
Katie Downing, Ken Evers-Hood, Mark Fordice, Chris 
Frimoth, Alana Garrigues, Marian Hammond, Brian Heron, 
Jim and Nancy Hicks, Apricot and David Irving, Alexis 
Kaushansky, Rebecca Lessem, Andrea Martin, Joan and 
Grady Miller, Jim Moiso, Michael Morrill, Dave 
Nieuwstraten, Julia Rodriguez-0’Donnell, Scott Roehm, 
Tara Schuster, Ryan Wilmot, Ben Wire, and Sarah 
Woodburn. 



Last but never least, thank you to my spouse, Jennifer 
Creswell, and our children, Liam and Graham. Jennifer 
continues to be incredibly encouraging, even though this 
endeavor has taken much of my time and energy. Liam 
stops everyone he can, even complete strangers, and tells 
them I am the author of William Shakespeare’s Star Wars. 
Graham shows his support through the biggest, strongest 
hugs an eight-year-old can give, which are the best cure for 
just about anything. Thank you, Jennifer, Liam, and 
Graham: you are my high every day.
