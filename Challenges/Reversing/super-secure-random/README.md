# Super Secure Random

## Test status: UNSOLVEABLE

Participants were able to reverse the challenge and generate numbers that would solve the challenge. However, the RNG on the hosted challenge would generate a different set of random numbers, even when switching to rand_r.

## Target Difficulty: Easy (150 Pts)

## Description

I created this cool new random number generator based on ðŸŒŒ *universal constants* ðŸŒŒ. It's so secure that I'm going to put a 150 point bounty on it!
