## Description

I was building [my new keyboard](https://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large-5/dirty-keyboard-joe-belanger.jpg) and listening to [relaxing asmr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EspwQ6Phw0g&list=WL&index=1&t=35s), but I must have messed it up because when I went to type the flag, all I got was gibberish. Can you help?
